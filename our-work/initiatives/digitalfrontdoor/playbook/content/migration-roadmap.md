##Content Migration Roadmap

###1. Understand User Needs
Start with understanding your users’ online needs. By conducting an online resident survey, you can assess the devices and types of internet access used in different parts of your city, evaluate user needs to prioritize content development on your site, and understand where your city has strong and weak connections to users of its website. 

Check out our [Run an Online Survey Guide](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/playbook/user-needs/run-a-resident-survey.html) to learn more about what kinds of questions to ask, and how to run the survey. You should aim for a response from at least 1 in 1,000 residents, with geographic, ethnic, and age distributions similar to your [city’s census data](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml). 

Analyze the results of your survey to make sure you are achieving responses that are representative of the entire community. Using zip code data and any socio-economic data collectived from the survey, identiy gaps in your reacy, and work to disseminate the survey to groups who were not accounted for during the initial outreach. You can use tactics in our [civic engagement standard](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/engagement/) to have better reach and a more holistic sample of the community. 


#####Oakland, CA Spotlight

In 2014, Code for America worked with the [City of Oakland](http://digifrodo.tumblr.com/post/101788428227/what-are-people-looking-for-on-city-websites) to conduct a resident survey.  



###2. Conduct a Content Audit
Conducting a content audit provides a quantitative understanding of how various webpages on your site are performing. It can help you determine which pages need to be pruned or consolidated on your site, which pages need to be rewritten, which pages are the most heavily trafficked, identify any gaps, and much more. 

In general, your content audit process should: 

* Collect all URLs on your site. 
* Gather KPIs and other information for each page. We suggest using both our [City Analytics Dashboard](https://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/city-analytics-dashboard/), a free tool that runs on Google Analytics, and [URL profiler](http://urlprofiler.com/), a free third-party tool that will gather various metrics, including:
	* Bounce Rate
	 * Exit rate
	 * Unique visitors
	* Word count
	* Sentence count
	* Grade level
    * Number of visits 
	
3. Analyze your content based on its metrics. Assign a specific action to each URL-- such as "keep", "remove", "update", etc. 

###3. Develop a Content Strategy 
Your online content is a representation of your city and the services it delivers. During a website redesign, you are not just migrating over old content one time- it is an ongoing process where content will be continuously analyzed, updated, refined, and even deleted. You must develop a clearly defined content strategy to reflect this. 

From your content audit, you should have identified your top performing pages. As you build out your content strategy, track progress against these pages. 

Your content strategy should consist of key values that can guide decisions you make about your web's content. This should include: 

* identifying a point person (or department) that will see individual pages
* a plan for regularly updating your content
* strategies to collect on-going feedback from users about your website
* criteria for when content can be archived or deleted 
* on-going plans to train and empower best practices around writing for the web 


###4. Create Internal Content Tools
 * Style guide
 * Reading level tools

###5. Hold Content Writing Sessions

A good city website is built upon information that is accurate and easy to understand. This can be achieved by letting subject matter experts (i.e. the department) own their online content, and teaching city staff to be confident web writers. 

Writing for the web background materials. Redesign reader. >> Ask Provo and Jack and Frances 

For new content writers, we suggest checking out: 

* “Don’t make me think” book (Steve Krug)
* Book Apart series 


#####Provo, UT Spotlight
based on learnings from Provo - 1 rep from every department every week. 
total # of people?
Provo: city departments would send someone; Mayor would ask for someone else. Clarify with department heads the qualities that you want. 
Editing the website is done by available admin; urge you to find people who are subject matter experts who understand the content well, person whose job is connected to communicating out information, people who have interest in technology and the web and see this as professional development opportunity
people from department with top traffic websites

Public information officer will maintain content for departments who have small traffic webpages. ie firefighters. 
technical piece is only small part of process; culture change and writing workshops need to be held in order to make it a sustainable content change 
design, IA -- strip those things out. Just start writing together.
