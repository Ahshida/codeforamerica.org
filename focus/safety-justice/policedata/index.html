  <h2>About the Police Open Data Census</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p><a href="https://codeforamerica.github.io/PoliceOpenDataCensus/">The Police Open Data Census</a> compiles currently available open datasets about police interactions with citizens in the US, including Use of Force, Officer-Involved Shootings, and Complaints Against Police. The Police Open Data Census was built with the city of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/indianapolis/" target="_blank">Indianapolis</a> in partnership with the White House Police Data Initiative to better understand policing challenges. The Police Open Data Census also helps communities identify actions they can take to improve law enforcement and community engagement. The data—presented in an easy to access and understand format—can help city residents, community groups, researchers, and journalists better understand neighborhood policing and engage with police and community leaders.</p>
