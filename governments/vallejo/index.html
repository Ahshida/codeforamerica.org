    <p>In 1996 the Pentagon closed the shipyard, Mare Island, which was located in Vallejo, California. Its closing contributed to loss of city revenue via property taxes, the closing of many local businesses, and left many residents jobless. The city filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and  the police department had to cut staffing by 40 percent. Police officers had limited capacity to respond to calls and build relationships with community members outside of emergency situations. This led to an uptick in violent incidents and a broken relationship between the police and the community. The city asked Code for America fellows to help them <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/05/19/police-data-what-do-people-want/">engage residents to improve public safety</a>.</p>

        <p>The Code for America fellowship is an opportunity for us to enhance communication and increase engagement, and to maximize public involvement and collaboration. The City Council and I are thrilled to have been selected after having made the application to Code for America a top priority this year. We look forward to the many possibilities that will surely come from this fantastic partnership.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>The 2015 Fellowship in Vallejo</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="layout-semibreve">

<h3>The Research</h3>
<p>During their year working with the city of Vallejo, the fellows conducted over 53 hours of interviews with residents, shadowed the police department in 18 different sessions, and reviewed 120 database tables with city records. They learned a lot. One of the first stories they heard during their research was that of Tina E. A Vallejo resident whose house was burglarized, Tina organized a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/01/26/doing-a-powerful-force-for-change/">neighborhood watch group</a> and as a result, crime in her neighborhood went down. The police department decided to hire her to lead the Community Services Section (CSS) of the police department. Since then, Tina has helped build hundreds of neighborhood watch groups and maintains a strong relationship with residents.</p> 
<p>In shadowing CSS and Tina, the fellows noticed that a copious amount of time was spent on intake. With about 200 calls to their voicemail inbox a week and a system that relied on members of the CSS team to transcribe these messages by hand, the fellowship team saw an opportunity to leverage technology to increase efficiency. With a more efficient system, CSS would be better equipped to respond faster and to more of the community.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>The Vallejo fellows identified 3 major goals for their project: to help CSS work efficiently, more collaboratively, and to enable them to serve more diverse segments of the Vallejo community. Enter <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/vallejo-css-toolkit">COMPASS</a>, a tool built to help CSS  with intake and management of reports of nuisance properties and quality of life. The tool features an interface that enables residents to file reports via web, text, and voice in english and spanish. For administration and analysis, the team worked with city staff to design a comfortable way to manage and update reports. Additionally, the Vallejo fellows and the CfA <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/focus/safety-justice/">Safety and Justice focus area</a> helped bring Vallejo law enforcement officials into <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/09/09/yes-open-data-but-remember-the-humans-behind-the-numbers/">conversation</a> with officials from Indianapolis, Richmond, CA, and Oakland, CA to discuss ways in which technology can help improve relations between police and the communities they serve.
 </p>
<br>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The city and CSS have taken over maintenance of <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/vallejo-css-toolkit">COMPASS</a>. The fellowship team left the city at the end of 2015 with a set of recommendations to derive insights from the community. In order to maintain operational efficiency and successfully serve the needs of the diverse communities living in the Vallejo, CSS should consider how people are using the tool and submitting their reports, which neighborhoods calls are coming from and which could use more access to the tool, etc. While trusting relationships are built by people, not digital tools, the hope is that <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/vallejo-css-toolkit">COMPASS</a> provides an entry point for residents to engage with police in a safe and open way.</p>
