				<h3>Project description</h3>
				<p>In partnership with Citymart (Citymart operates an online market place to connect cities and solution providers (private industry)), Barcelona launched <a href="http://bcnopenchallenge.org/">BCN|Open Challenge</a> to encourage smaller companies to compete for government procurement contracts. The Open Challenge deviates from the traditional RFP process by soliciting proposals in a competition from any company for solutions to six broadly identified challenges in the city.</p>
				<p>The BCN|Open Challenge (Open Challenge) is an open call to obtain innovative solutions for each of the six challenges defined for the city of Barcelona. “Within the framework of the economic development initiative Barcelona Growth, BCN|Open Challenge is a new programme opening up the city administration to [small & medium enterprises] from around the world to transform public services. By seeking solutions to the city’s challenges with a more inclusive process.” The goal is to drive public procurement from innovation providers, in order to allow for faster development, encourage local economic growth, while delivering improved public services.</p>

				<h3>Problem statement</h3>
				<p>The Open Challenge seeks to focus Barcelona’s public procurement on “innovation providers.” Innovation providers include small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and startups, which do not currently operate in the public sector. Often these companies are not engaging in the procurement system because of regulations that erect barriers to entry that make it prohibitive or restrictions on possible bids that obstruct testing innovative solutions. As a result, Barcelona does not benefit as much as it could from innovative solutions from the private sector in terms of cost competition and innovative solutions; and, SMEs and startups are not able to benefit from potential contracts with the city of Barcelona to grow their business, something that hurts the company and the local economy.</p>
				
				<h3>Participating Cities</h3>
				<p>Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.</p>

				<h3>When</h3>
				<p>The submission period finished on June 16, 2014, with winners expected to be announced November/December 2014.</p>

				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>In response to the economic crisis in Spain, the city of Barcelona launched <a href="https://http://w42.bcn.cat/barcelonabusiness/en/">Barcelona Growth</a>. Barcelona Growth is a collection of policies and measures to promote Barcelona’s economic development. The Open Challenge is one program within this package of policies with a specific focus on opening up Barcelona’s administration to SMEs to accelerate innovation and leverage public spending more effectively to deliver better public services.</p>
				<p>In practice, the Open Challenge is a “call for businesses and entrepreneurs to propose their innovative solutions to six different challenges to transform public space and services in the city.” The selected issues included (i) reducing bicycle thefts in the city, (ii) empowering support systems to reduce social isolation, (iii) monitoring pedestrian flows in the city, (iv) tools for digitization of museum and archive collections, (v) automatic detection and alerts of damaged road surfaces, and (vi) empowering local retail through technology.</p>
				<p>For each challenge, the desired outcome is a signed contract with a vendor to address the aforementioned challenge. But the more immediate goals are to generate a sufficient number of quality submissions from prospective vendors to demonstrate sufficient interest by the business community to participate in this new approach to procurement. In so doing, the organizers can erect a foundation for more substantive and far-reaching modifications to the procurement process as a whole.</p>
				<p>The Open Challenge, however, is still relatively new (applications were accepted until June 16, 2014). As a result, it is too early to define metrics for success because of the early stage of the process. The most basic factor of evaluation will be whether any contracts are, in fact, signed. But looking ahead, the goal of the Open Challenge – “to design and deliver new tools to support more open problem solving, to catalyse innovation and to accelerate business growth in the city” - would appear to put an emphasis on evaluating the characteristics of the vendors.</p>
				<p>Finally, it is important to note that the organizers anticipate developing metrics specific to each challenge. These metrics will be developed in collaboration with the winning vendors during the contracting phase. This approach provides a more flexible framework that deviates from the traditional prescriptive approach and allows the metrics to be tied to the winning solution. Furthermore, it will provide a basis of metrics for future iterations of the Open Challenge.</p>

				<h4>Problems/Issues</h4>
				<p>The Open Challenge seeks to focus Barcelona’s public procurement on “innovation providers.” Innovation providers include small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and startups, which do not currently operate in the public sector. Often these companies are not engaging in the procurement system because of regulations that erect barriers to entry that make it prohibitive or restrictions on possible bids that obstruct testing innovative solutions. As a result, Barcelona does not benefit as much as it could from innovative solutions from the private sector in terms of cost competition and innovative solutions; and, SMEs and startups are not able to benefit from potential contracts with the city of Barcelona to grow their business, something that hurts the company and the local economy.</p>
				
				<h3>Process</h3>
				<p>The City of Barcelona launched an initiative, <a href="http://w42.bcn.cat/web/en/what-is/introduction/index.jsp">Barcelona Growth</a>, in 2013 as a “package of policies and measures aimed at promoting the economic development of the city of Barcelona.” The Open Challenge is one program within this initiative. The Open Challenge was created in partnership with <a href="http://www.citymart.com/#inspiring-solutions-to-transform-cities">Citymart</a> to transform the public procurement process by making it more open and focused on generating innovative solutions to urban issues. Citymart, founded in 2011, operates a marketplace for vendors to connect with government procurement offices.</p>
				<p>The Open Challenge proposal developed out of work led by a staff member of the mayoral administration. This project manager managed Barcelona’s <a href="http://www.22barcelona.com/content/view/698/897/lang,en/">Urban Lab</a>. The Urban Lab was launched by the City Council of Barcelona to “facilitate the use of public space as an urban laboratory available to companies to test their products and services in a real environment…to encourage business innovation…that provides improvements to the daily lives of the people of Barcelona.” This role gave the project manager a mandate to experiment with new approaches to the procurement process. As part of this role, the project manager worked with Citymart.</p>
				<p>Based on the work with Urban Lab and Citymart, the project manager proposed the Open Challenge in 2013. The city director (administrator) responsible for Economics, Business, and Employment, embraced the proposal, which was then picked up as a policy initiative by the Deputy Mayor that manages policy for Economics, Business, and Employment. Under this leadership, other government departments were brought in, such as communications to help publicize the Open Challenge. And agencies were identified and recruited to provide challenges as participants. The agencies drafted specific challenges in consultation with Citymart; Citymart then assisted in drafting the final challenges to make them accessible to a broad range of private industry. The program was officially launched in Spring 2014, with submissions accepted until June 16, 2014.</p>
				<p>The key stakeholders can be divided into two groups. The first group can be described as the program champions. The program champions led the political and policy drive to erect and execute the project. This includes the Deputy Mayor, the City Administrator, and the project manager. Today the Mayor is a champion and touts the Open Challenge as “one of the city’s two top priorities.” The second group can be described as the engine of the government; this included the specific agencies that defined the problems used in the Open Challenge and serve as the “Expert Panelists”[1] to review submissions.  It also includes the communications department, which has led the marketing strategy to promote the initiative (50,000 visits to the project website were registered within 21 days of publication – 70% from Spain, 30% international). Outside of the government actors, the community is involved primarily through the jury process. A jury determines the awarding of contracts. The jury is comprised of a variety of stakeholders from the city, industry leaders, and academia.</p>
				<p>In setting up the Open Challenge, Barcelona identified the specific problems, allocated agency staff time, dedicated communications and publicity support, and committed up to €1,000,000.00 (approximately $1.36M at the time of this writing) in potential contracts. Citymart led the program development and provided subject matter expertise in the procurement process. For instance, Citymart reviewed potential problems identified by the city to provide feedback; assisted the city in preparing problem statements that would be better understood by companies that lacked experience working with government entities; provided a resource for managing international companies located within the European Union (EU) and beyond; provided assistance in developing policies and information for compliance with EU law for non-Spanish companies; and, provided feedback on the proposed problem statements to ensure they were solutions focused, not crafted in the traditional model of solution prescription. Another substantive area of support is Citymart’s ability to engage in outreach to companies to request submissions or talk through problems.</p>
				<p>In the process of developing the program, Citymart identified two key challenges: culture change and problem statement preparation. Because of the new approach, the city agencies needed to be acclimatized to the program. Buy-in by the agencies evolved as the challenges were drafted, feedback provided, and agency needs clarified. The second issue, the problem statement preparation, is a work in progress, as the efforts to shift from the traditional approach (extensive scoping of the problem with prescribed solutions by government agencies) shifts to a new approach (general problem description with objectives outlined for innovative solutions by industry).</p>

				<h3>Costs &amp; Savings</h3>
				<p>The costs for the Open Challenge are effectively indirect, aside from the potential contracts. One staff member of the city of Barcelona is assigned to the Open Challenge. But this project manager already works in the Barcelona Urban Lab and is tasked with introducing new initiatives. As a result, their costs are already allocated in the general budget.</p>
				<p>Although it is difficult to determine, an off the cuff estimate of staff costs was put in the region of 200,000.00 USD. But these costs include one-year of work, pioneering new frameworks and multiple departments and organizations. For example, staff costs include, but are not limited to, the project manager from Urban Lab that leads the Open Challenge; the Citymart team, external legal advice, time spent by relevant department heads and staff to identify and craft the six problems (e.g. Technical Services, Transport and Mobility for the BCN Metropolitan Area, Family, Social Services, or Barcelona Library, etc.), and, the city’s communications department.</p>
				<p>One of the largest costs was the communications campaign. The city of Barcelona, via the communications department, developed a publicity strategy to publicize the project throughout Barcelona. This campaign leveraged existing communications tools, namely existing publicity platforms on public transportation, e.g. on buses or subways. This kept costs to a minimum, because the campaign was effectively in-kind.</p>
				<p>The total value of the contract, for all six potential contracts, is €1,000,000.00. This includes Value Added Taxes (VAT). For each of the six challenges, the contract is offered between €60,000.00 and €250,000.00, but this does not include VAT. The total amount, €1,000,000.00, is to be distributed between the selected contract awardees. The distribution of the contract monies, however, does not need to be of an equal amount. For example, one company may receive €60,000.00, and another €100,000.00. But no company will receive less than €60,000.00 or more than €250,000.00, and the total contracts allocated cannot exceed €1,000,000.00 including VAT.</p>
				<p>Citymart is also promoting the event on its online marketplace; but contracts are between the city of Barcelona and the winning submissions, not Citymart. This limits the costs of the program largely to the city’s indirect labor costs, contracting Citymart support services and in-kind communications plan. Companies have only the internal costs of application.</p>

					<h2 id="outcomes">Results</h2>
				</div>

				<p>The first cycle has not yet been completed. Therefore, no conclusions about the submissions or success/failure of any responses to the challenges can be assessed. Outside of the programmatic activities, however, some definable results were achieved. Furthermore, the high level of public engagement was an unexpected success and introduced lessons that can and will be applied to other cities and similar initiatives.</p>
				<p>Two critical outcomes can be identified at this stage. The first success was launching of the program and the substantial support received from both the administrative offices and the elected leadership. The Open Challenge is a first of its kind for Barcelona. The program broke new ground, even though it is under the Barcelona Growth initiative. Today the Open Challenge is one of the top priorities from the city, with the Mayor championing it. But the program’s origins were the result of one staff member’s commitment to new methods and approaches. This individual’s leadership, combined with political support led to a substantive financial commitment of €1,000,000.00. The second key result was the buy-in by the local agencies. Although it took time to educate the agency staff members on the process, and there was significant modification to the initial six challenges, agency buy-in was achieved.</p>

				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<h4>Programmatic Outcomes and Metrics</h4>
				<p>Following the conclusion of the first cycle of applications and awarding contracts, the organizers will be able to more accurately identify the metrics of success. These metrics will likely fall into two sets of categories. The first category will examine the totality of the process as it relates to the goals of driving innovative solutions and building an ecosystem around the Barcelona procurement process to drive the local economy. For example, metrics might include determining whether the bids are strictly from traditional vendors or introduced new vendors to the procurement ecosystem; and, whether the applying vendors are generating new solutions (e.g. repurposing products/services from the private marketplace) or whether they are following the traditional model of developing specific solutions for public contracts.</p>
				<p>The second category would be more specific to the individual challenges. Metrics specific to each challenge will be defined in discussion between Barcelona and the winning company during the contracting session. The agreed upon metrics will be used to evaluate the awarded contracts to determine if they are, in fact, providing solutions. It is anticipated that these metrics will serve as a model going forward for other agencies in future iterations of the Open Challenge; notably, these metrics will be public, so they can be used in Barcelona or other cities.</p>
				<p>One emergent outcome has been the strong reception by the community. Because the Open Challenge is, effectively, seeking to crowdsource solutions to problems, there must be a significant amount awareness of the program. Within 21 days, there have been over 50,000 website views –the most of any program Citymart has been a part of, most receive approximately 7,000 views over a 3-month period.</p>

				
				<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
				<p>Below are five lessons that were identified that include modification of the approach and areas to expand.</p>
				<p>The first lesson is to determine what procurement process to use in the beginning. The organizers found that the final design of the Request for Proposal (RFP) model could not have been anticipated. There are various procurement processes, e.g. Request for Quotation (RFQ), Invitation to Bid (ITB), RFP, Expression of Interest (EOI), or Request for Information (RFI). Each has unique rules and requirements.</p>
				<p>Technically, Open Challenged uses a two-stage process – an open ideas competition (limited to solutions with a track record of at least a prototype) leading to a maximum of five finalists for each challenge, followed by a <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Procurement/Selling/SupplierJourney/bidding/bidding-routes-2and3/contract-award-procedures/negotiated-procedure">Negotiated Procedure</a>, an EU form of contracting in which the specifications and terms of contract are developed jointly between government and finalists of the ideas competition. In the EU, the recently introduced <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Procurement/Selling/SupplierJourney/bidding/bidding-routes-2and3/contract-award-procedures/competitive-dialogue-proc">Competitive Dialogue</a> delivers a similar process and is likely to be a more effective model for future problem-based procurements.</p>
				<p>Selecting a particular method then dictates the form the bidding of the Open Challenge. As a result, multiple stakeholders were needed “at the table,” (such as the city’s attorneys), not just the agencies participating in the Open Challenge. Going forward, the organizers would select the exact procurement process sooner - before discussion around drafting challenges begins - by having stakeholders involved at an earlier phase of program design.</p>
				<p>The second lesson is to engage with agencies as soon as possible to educate them on how to prepare a non-traditional problem statement. Traditional procurement problem statements are very detailed and prescribe the solution. For example, the compiled first draft of the RFP text excluding problem statements for the Open Challenge was about 60-page document. By the launch of the program, Citymart worked with city agencies to reduce the entire RFP package including six problem statements to a half of that size, approximately 30 pages. Going forward, Citymart would engage with the agencies sooner to provide templates for even smaller RFP documents. The goal is a 15-page RFP package.</p>
				<p>The third lesson is to develop a more sustained outreach program with companies that do not traditionally seek government contracts. One of the goals of the Open Challenge is to expand beyond the small pool of companies that normally do business with the city of Barcelona. But often these non-traditional companies are not aware of potential government contracts, let alone special programs, such as the Open Challenge. To address this issue, Citymart engages in directed outreach and engagement with 200 pre-identified companies per challenge to inform them about potential market opportunities and ease of submission through the Open Challenge process. This process is fairly laborious; for example, Citymart estimated that each company required, on average, five unique outreach efforts. Citymart defines outreach as a direct interaction with a company representative via email or phone. To-date, no other mechanism is readily available to replicate the market research and outreach function delivered by Citymart.</p>
				<p>The fourth lesson was to develop a model template for an improved user experience/user interface (UX/UI). During the programmatic design with the city agencies, the design process became a dominant point of discussion. Making the process user friendly was always an early goal. The difficulty, however, was changing the approach of the agencies from “protecting government” to “make it easy to participate.” Going forward, Citymart would work to develop a template that addresses the main concerns of government agencies, but allows applicants to easily navigate the process. For example, Barcelona only accepted bids via paper (requiring an identical digital copy to be presented on Citymart). As a result, the Open Challenge process actually takes place entirely online, but applicants must still submit a paper version by post.</p>
				<p>Fifth, and finally, publicity does work, but needs a strategy and plan. The Open Challenge received an unprecedented number of visits to the websites. No other challenge that Citymart has participated in has reached this number (over 100 challenges to date). It is generally believed that this awareness by the community was driven by the city’s commitment to publicize the Open Challenge using city resources, namely advertising locations in the transportation system. This was achieved through videos on subway cars, billboards in subway stations, and posted advertisements on buses. Going forward, Citymart plans to encourage other cities to replicate this model.</p>

					<h2 id="next">Next Steps</h2>
				</div>

				<p>The Open Challenge currently operates under the management of the Deputy Mayor’s Office. Thus, future efforts to continue the program are anticipated through the same office. But the long-term goal of the Open Challenge is to experiment with new approaches to the procurement process generally, to determine if more effective methods can be adopted and at what cost. For example, whether Barcelona can adopt an online system and move away from a paper submission requirement. Accordingly, the Open Challenge can be sustained directly through the work of the Mayor’s office, but can equally be sustained indirectly through new practices in the procurement process or by agencies.</p>
				<p>In the immediate future, the organizers plan to complete the current cycle by the end of 2014. But already at the current evaluation stage there is a debrief underway with the participating stakeholders (i.e. Mayor’s office, agencies, industry, and the community) to determine the features of the next edition of the program with new challenges.</p>
				<p>Outside of Barcelona, the basic framework for the Open Challenge will continue through the work of Citymart. Citymart will take the lessons learned and apply them to templates and models for future cities to launch their own Open Challenge. In parallel, Citymart will leverage the lessons learned to further develop the marketplace platform for cities and companies to discover and contract with each other.</p>
