  <h2>About AddressIQ</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>AddressIQ was developed with the City of Long Beach to reduce the demand on emergency services by collecting and presenting data on 911 calls to city staff. AddressIQ takes data from the fire department and the police department, cross-references addresses with business license data, and presents the data back to city staff in a way that helps them make informed decisions to take action. In AddressIQ city staff can see the highest-priority, highest-ems-utilizing addresses. Staff can also sort by the highest number of calls for either fire—which includes emergency medical calls—or police, get context, and filter by date range to see how the calls have changed over time. AddressIQ gives city staff in different departments a place to view and coordinate their actions to help the city better use their resources to help people.

  <h2>The Product</h2>
<div class="layout-minim">
  <p>AddressIQ is a web application that analyzes city data to help identify addresses with a high number of 911 calls and support finding cost-effective ways to provide those addresses with better care and resources. The application synthesizes and analyzes data from the fire department and the police department, cross references them with business license data, and presents the data back to City Staff. </p>
  <p>This data can't tell us about individuals, it can only tell us about addresses. The development and any findings must be framed accordingly.</p>
