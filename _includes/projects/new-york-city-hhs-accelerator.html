				<h3>Project description</h3>
				<p>HHS Accelerator is designed to simplify and improve the competitive contract and financial processes for Providers that deliver health and human services to New York City clients and communities.</p>
				<p>New York launched the HHS Accelerator in 2012 to reduce the complexity and duplication in the procurement process for service providers and agencies working with the Department of Heath and Human Services. The HHS Accelerator developed new business processes and a technical platform, Data Vault, to improve document submission, data managed and collection, and improve government reporting and transparency.</p>
				<p>The City of New York officially launched its Health and Human Services (HHS) Accelerator initiative in 2010 to reduce the complexity and duplication of the procurement process for service Providers working with HHS Agencies. The HHS Accelerator System officially went live for use by Providers and Agencies Spring 2013.</p>


				<h3>Problem statement</h3>
				<p>Providers, primarily nonprofits, are the primary channel by which human services in New York are delivered. More than 1,200 providers deliver approximately $4B in services annually through 3,700 contracts per year, on behalf of New York City. But complexity and duplication in the “procurement and contracting system [has led to] inefficiency, delays and inconsistency, all of which cause issues for both the City and providers.” For example, prospective providers found it difficult to understand City requirements and compete for funding. The vast majority of contracts was awarded through competitive Request for Proposal (RFP)  – a heavily paper-based process that took on average 15 months from solicitation issuance to contract registration, and included lengthy intermediate process steps. Once under contract, the financial management of contracts was also mostly paper-based and burdensome administratively. Many Agencies utilize custom designed systems but none were provider-facing or allowed for advancing additional standardization of practices Citywide. The HHS Accelerator was proposed as an initiative to strengthen the nonprofit community following the economic downturn in 2009, and the need to make the procurement process for human services more efficient.</p>					

				<h3>Participating Cities</h3>
				<p>New York, New York.</p>

				<h3>When</h3>
				<p>Plans for HHS Accelerator were announced in 2009, a project team started in 2010, and the first release of the HHS Accelerator System went live in March 2013. . The HHS Accelerator is in operation today and has expanded to 12 agencies from the original 11. RFPs were first released through the system in October 2013. Today, the HHS Accelerator operates with nearly 1800 provider organizations that hold accounts, over 60 health and human services RFPs released to the public, and north of 300 awards issued.</p>

				</div>

				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>The city found that “providers, primarily nonprofits, deliver over $4B in services annually on behalf of New York City.” Unfortunately, the procurement process is often complex and riddled with duplication, which creates inefficiency for agencies and providers (Seven specific issues with the procurement process were identified: Complex, slow and error-prone processes, Under-utilization of information technology (IT) in procurement and contract management, Limited reporting into workflow and performance, Rigid contracts and requests for proposals (RFPs) with high administrative effort and cost, Multi-level oversight within and outside of agencies, Inconsistency within and across agencies and Inconsistent standards for administrative overhead). The purpose of the HHS Accelerator is to (i) Improve City contracting procedures, (ii) Strengthen Nonprofits, and (iii) reduce costs. For example, the city identified 220 programs across 11 Mayoral agencies that purchase similar services across multiple neighborhoods. Nonetheless, it took an average of 15 months from the issuance of an RFP to contract registration. Furthermore, the process was decentralized, which meant a lack of shared standards across agencies of rates, services area frameworks, and obstacles for cross agency collaboration performance assessment and consistent rate payment.</p>
				<p>Six specific outcomes were outlined to address these challenges: (i) Make the procurement process faster and simpler; (ii) Reduce redundant paper‐based contracting burdens for Service Providers and Agencies, lowering administrative costs; (iv) Strengthen and broaden the pool of Service Providers doing business with the City; (v) Leverage technology to streamline process and facilitate transparency; and, (vi) Redeploy staff and resources from administrative functions to core mission activity.</p>
				<p>Specific projected benefits for each key stakeholder group includes:</p>
				<p>Providers (primarily NYC-based, nonprofit, human services organizations): 
  1.  Reduced administrative burden by spending less time repeatedly compiling the same paper documents in response to RFPs or to register changes in contracts.
  2.  Increased understanding of contract and service requirements, especially for Providers new to doing business with the City
  3.  Greater accuracy in accounting for contract finances.</p>
				<p>Agencies (participating HHS Accelerator Agencies): 
  1.  Less time spent on document collection, enabling redistribution of time to mission-critical tasks and other areas of vendor relationship management
  2.  Increased collaboration across Agencies, especially those administering services within the same health and human services domain or where service are complementary and enhance program quality.</p>
				<p>Mayor’s Office: 
  1.  Improved coordination of health and human services contracts
  2.  Ability to quickly implement programs in response to new needs and policies
  3.  Enhanced benchmarking, trend analysis, and forecasting capabilities to inform local priorities
  4.  Maintain a vibrant and strong vendor pool.</p>

				<h3>Process</h3>
				<p>In April of 2009, the Mayor of New York gave a speech to support the nonprofit sector in New York City. Specifically, the Mayor sought to identify ways to strengthen the nonprofit community during the economic downturn. As part of this effort, the city determined that the Department of Health and Human Services held nearly $4B in contracts with providers that were nearly all nonprofits. And restructuring the procurement process to make contracting easier would help both nonprofits reduce their costs to acquire contracts, but also benefit the city in delivering services.</p>
				<p>In 2010, these initiatives were formalized into a proposal for the HHS Accelerator. The framework of the HHS Accelerator was led by the administrative leadership of the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health & Human Services. The Deputy Mayor led an Executive Steering Committee that met regularly to design the HHS Accelerator. Other members of the Executive Committee included the Mayor’s Contract Services, the Office of Management and Budget, and Commissioners from the (11) agencies that would eventually participate in the Accelerator. This Committee met quarterly, with the Deputy Mayor’s Office meeting monthly with agency liaisons. In addition to the government actors, a nonprofit working group participated at various times to test the new software systems for usability and feedback.</p>
				<p>On April 9, 2012, Mayor Bloomberg signed Executive Order 160 (Executive order, HHS Accelerator, No. 160 (April 9, 2012)). This Order established the HHS Accelerator, located it within the Office of the Mayor, and appointed a Director to the HHS Accelerator to report to the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services.</p>
				<p>Today, an Executive Committee governs the HHS Accelerator. This Committee is comprised of the Chair (Deputy Mayor of Health and Human Services); Voting Members from the Commissioners of the (11) participating agencies; Advisors from Mayor’s Office of Contracts and Services and the City Attorney’s Office; Partners that include the Chief Information Officer of Health and Human Services, the Department of Information of Technology & Telecommunications, and the Office of Management and Budget; and, Project Leaders from the HHS Accelerator. Finally, “each Agency has designated a senior staff person to oversee and coordinate work from their Agency”(HHS Accelerator, Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health & Human Services, page 10 of 11 (Spring 2012)).</p>
				<p>Nonprofit stakeholders include the Strength Nonprofits Task Force. This taskforce does not have voting power, but serves as a voice for nonprofits to engaged with the HHS Accelerator and the Executive Committee. The participating entities were selected to represent the sector and a range of communities: Archdiocese of NY, Asian American Federation, Black Equity Alliance, Blue Ridge Foundation of NYC, Cases, COFCCA, Community Resource Exchange, FPWA, Hispanic Federation, Hudson Guild, Human Services Council, Mayor’s Fund to Advance NYC/Greater NY, New York Community Trust, New York Immigration Coalition, Non Profit Coordinating Committee, Nonprofit Finance Fund, Philanthropy NY, Public Health Solutions, SAYA, SCO Family of Services, UJA.</p>
				<p>Important development milestones included:<p>
 					<ul>
					<li>Issued an executive order for City Agencies to implement reforms, and utilized existing City of New York Procurement Policy Board (PPB) rules which allowed for management innovation. (The PPB issues rules governing City procurement)</li>
					<li>Reached stakeholder agreement on business reengineering actions and new processes</li>
					<li>Published a comprehensive, collaboratively developed service catalog which providers use to indicate service experience and from which Agencies construct RFPs</li>
					<li>Established a new streamlined RFP template for use by all participating Agencies</li>
					<li>Achieved cross-Agency agreement on a standardized but flexible electronic budget template and related workflow for Provider contract budgets</li>
					<li>Codified the new procurement process in PPB Rule 3-16</li>
					<li>Incrementally deployed major system components</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Release 1:</p>
				<p>Document Vault for providers to store and share frequently requested organizational documents with the City</p>
				<p>The HHS Accelerator Application where providers establish business integrity and service experience prior to competing for funding. (This component was deployed early to allow time for system adoption prior to releasing RFPs.)</p>
				<p>Release 2:</p> 
				<p>Procurements management module which enables electronic issuance of RFPs, paperless submission and evaluation of proposals, and online management of contract awards, and</p>
				<p>Release 3:</p>
 				<p>Financials module which allows submission of budgets and invoices for review, as well as processing and tracking budget modifications and payments.</p>


				<h3>Costs &amp; Savings</h3>
				<p>The HHS Accelerator initiative emerged from the Office of the Mayor, specifically under the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services. As a result, the indirect costs were limited to the staff time to design the initiative; these staff costs also includes the staff from other agencies on the Executive Committee that contributed to the design of the HHS Accelerator.</p>
				<p>The HHS Accelerator, however, has only been in operation for approximately two-years. As a result, it is still too early to draft definitive conclusions on total costs or savings. Nonetheless, Analysis of Return on Investment (ROI) is in progress and will be completed after at least one full year of operation for procurement and financial components, where savings are anticipated. Examples of areas for analysis include, but are not limited to, whether nonprofits are able to decrease their costs because of electronic document management, accuracy in financial contract management due to system enforced accounting, diversity of competition and awards to new providers; Agency staff time spent on procurement management, proposal evaluation, budget/invoice review; and, timeliness of payments.</p>

					<h2 id="outcomes">Results</h2>
				</div>

				<p>Generally speaking, analysis of impact is in progress and will be complete after at least full year of operation for all system components and process changes. There are approximately 1800 organizations with accounts, over 60 RFPs have been released, and 300+ awards have been issued for health and human services delivery. RFPs page length has been reduced by 80%, and proposers and leaders have reported high levels of satisfaction with new formats and process. Weeks have been saved on significant Agency procurement phases such as RFP development, release, proposal review & evaluation, and issuing vendor awards.</p>
				<p>More specifically, in designing the HHS Accelerator, three recommendations were made. First, Implement cross-agency prequalification and Master Service Agreements for human services. In practice, this meant simplifying multiple documentation submission requirements, creating a Data Vault, developing prequalification and common taxonomy for human services, and erecting a new HHS procurement business function. Second, Re-engineer processes and improve their transparency. New technology was required to automate and integrate the workflow to make collaboration, reporting, and transparency easier. And third, Institutionalize collaboration across the human services system (Achieving High Performance Relationships with Providers of Human Services, page 2 (April 2010)).</p>
				<p>All three of these recommendations, to some degree, have been achieved. For example, the Executive Order establishing the HHS Accelerator authorized the HHS Accelerator Director to develop prequalified lists, standards contracts, and Master Service Agreements. In turn, this allowed the business process of procurement to be redesigned to allow agencies to use shared systems and all see the same information from providers; it also increased transparency by giving providers, and citizens, more information about how the process itself works and why decisions were made. Finally, the Data Vault provides the technical platform with opportunity to add new functionality. It allows agencies and the HHS Accelerator to generate Performance Reports, as well as Financial Health Reports (HHS Accelerator, Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health & Human Services, page 9 of 11. PowerPoint Slide. (Spring 2012)); and, the platform was built to allow for integration with other platform and tools to integrate data from other entities, such as the federal government, that might be desired in the future.</p>
				<p>It is still too soon to identify definitive metrics of success. Although “as of mid-May, a total of 614 nonprofits have already opened accounts and begun the process of uploading documents and preparing prequalification applications” (<a href="http://www.nynp.biz/index.php/this-months-feature/15908-state-and-city-take-two-roads-to-reform-nyc-hhs-accelerator">New York Nonprofit Press, (June 11, 2014))</a>. Once more data is acquired, however, the existing tools will allow HHS Accelerator staff to analyze substantial granular data about contracts, costs, time, processes, and so forth. Examples of future metrics to assess might include whether the system has made it easier for smaller nonprofits to participate in the procurement process. And, whether the system opens up the silos that often exist to allow agencies to receive bids from new service providers; thereby creating increased competition for contracts, which will either reduce costs or improve the services provided.</p>
				<p>The HHS Accelerator also operates the HHS Accelerator Data Project (Accelerator Data Project). The Accelerator Data Project uses “data from the IRS Form 990 [to] provide aggregate reports on NYC Client and Community Services providers” in four areas: Debt to Net Asset, Net Asset Balances, Major Expense Categories as Percent of Total Expenses, and Current Asset Composition (<a href=" http://www.nyc.gov/html/hhsaccelerator/html/data/data.shtml">HHS Accelerator Data Project, (June 11, 2014))</a>. The purpose of the Accelerator Data Project is “to help New York City’s nonprofit organizations more easily and effectively manage data, benchmark performance, and share information with stakeholders and funders.”</p>
				<p>The metrics employed in the Accelerator Data Project are not directly related to the HHS Accelerator’s objectives and metrics for success. The Accelerator Data Project, however, provides a potential blueprint for how the data is collected, aggregated, shared, and leveraged by providers (companies), agencies (government), and even citizens.</p>


				<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
				<p>Although final reviews and lessons learned have not yet been published, it is important to note three key elements which advanced the project and contributes to its success:</p>
				<p>1)	Engagement of subject matter experts at each phase of development. Collaboration has been critical not only for system and process adoption but essential in design, ensuring that the HHS Accelerator System is intuitive for end-users and underlying business process work for multiple internal and external stakeholder groups.</p>
				<p>2)	Phased implementation. Launching different functionality over the course of 18 months allowed leaders and system users to make business process adjustments incrementally, acknowledging the diversity of infrastructure among service providers. Technical enhancements were also deployed periodically in response to user feedback and without the need for any complete design overhauls.</p>
				<p>3)	Central team. Dedicating a nimble central team with diverse expertise amongst the members that included procurement, financial management, informational technology, policy and nonprofit management allowed for deep, productive stakeholder engagement. The team was also able to quickly translate current to future state practice. They will be responsible for infrastructure maintenance and initiative oversight.</p>

					<h2 id="next">Next Steps</h2>
				</div>

				<p>The original concept of the HHS Accelerator purposefully limited the program to Health and Human Services. The long-term implication, however, is to apply the model outside of Health and Human Services. For instance, the DataVault is not limited to Health and Human Services. The platform can be repurposed and modified to fit the needs of other procurement systems. This is incredibly important since Health and Human Services is estimated to spend approximately $4B a year, and New York City’s budget is project at approximately $74B for 2014-2015.</p>
				<p>Three specific next steps were identified:</p>
				<p>·       Expansion of financials module to additional HHS Agency program areas in FY2015</p>
<p>·       Project implementation review and ROI analysis.</p>
<p>·       Ongoing deployment of process improvements and system enhancements.</p>
