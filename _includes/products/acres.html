      <p> Finding land for urban farming can be difficult. Acres is a tool that surface the municipal data like zoning regulations, water billing data, and soil characteristics in a farmer friendly manner. The tool provides farmers with the information they need and connects them with landowners. The city, or any private landowner, can take the first step in creating an urban farm by drawing a future farm site on the map, so that all information about that property is immediately available. Then, the farmer directly connects with the landowner, negotiates a lease agreement, and starts sowing seeds soon thereafter.</p>

      <p><h3 class="text-prominent">Background</h3></p>
      <p>
West Sacramento has a vision to become a place where itâ€™s easy to establish urban farms, and where those farms can quickly connect with their surrounding communities to maximize the extent to which farmers and nearby residents alike share in the farm's bounty. The Fellowship program aimed to increase local awareness of, and consumption of food from, local farms. Fellows looked to address food deserts by making it easier to start new urban farms, and enable local farmers to connect with their surrounding communities and promote the sale of farm-fresh produce directly to residents.</p>
