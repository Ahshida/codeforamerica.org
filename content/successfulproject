<h2>Making a Successful Project</h2>

<h4>Laying the Groundwork for Successful Projects </h4>

<p>Scoping the problem takes a lot of time. Before the project begins (and oftentimes even before the city applies for the program), no decisions are made about the exact technology that will be used and/or developed for the project. Instead, we try to identify initial technological issues, digital skill gaps  (Google Analytics, user research, etc.), project goals, and desired outcomes. 

<h4>Setting Up A Successful Government Partner Team</h4>

<p>CfA works to establish a strong leadership team working in the city government to support fellows. The criteria for this strong leadership team is that they have <b>internal influence</b>, <b>subject matter expertise</b>, and are <b>trained in the fellowship process</b>. This helps there to be a clear understanding at all levels about how the fellowship works. It’s important to remove perceived and/or structural blockers to people’s support or involvement in the program. </p>
<p> Other partners may include foundations, nonprofits, and corporate sponsors. It’s advisable to involve these groups in conversations with the city early on, not just about fundraising for the program, but also about the project itself. Many of these groups will have a lot of subject-matter expertise and deep roots in the community.  </p>
<p>The involvement of non-government partners should be carefully managed to strike a balance between giving the fellows an appropriate amount of autonomy by ensuring partners don’t impose their own agenda but also cultivating a healthy collaboration between the two. It’s important to reinforce a focus on the citizen and government’s role in providing for citizens, not on any one partner’s agenda.  </p>

<h4>Preparing Government Partners for the Program</h4>

<p>It’s important to get everyone on the same page and set the stage for the fellowship program to be a success. Setting up the right team support structure within government for the fellows, fostering continued government engagement, and encouraging ongoing participation are all crucial for this piece. We do this though:</p>
<ul>

<li>Periodic emails with relevant information</li>

<li>Creating a government google group as a forum for Q&A</li>

<li>Formal orientation webinars (one per city)</li>

<li>Creating a Fellowship Guidebook</li>

<li>Conference calls with government staff to discuss program scope</li>

<li>On-boarding sessions</li>

<li>Inviting City Parnters to attend our annual Summit to be a part of the community</li>

<li>Site visits of CfA staff to partner cities</li>

</ul>

<h4>Things to keep in mind during prep work:</h4>

<ul>

<li>Generate enthusiasm and excitement for the program</li>

<li>Orient governments on program details</li>

<li>Create a useful forum for Q&A, comments and feedback</li>

<li>Set expectations of CfA participation experience</li>

<li>Support government partners in gaining broader support for CfA in their governments</li>

<li>Create a unified understanding of government problem areas and areas of focus</li>

<li>Involve other community groups who exercise local leadership and have subject matter expertise from the community</li>

</ul>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>We heavily rely on the fellows to push the project forward once the project has started, but CfA staff is very involved. CfA staff works continuously to support government partners overcome obstacles, get others excited about the program, and give advice about how to more productively engage with fellows.  In the future, Code for America is looking at ways to more concretely support cities throughout the program through more trainings and moretargeted engagement during the course of the Fellowship program.</p>
