		<h3>Health Focus Area Overview</h3>
		<h4>Our Mission</h4>
		<p>Code for America’s Focus Areas are where we demonstrate the human impact of 21st Century Government and improved digital services. In 2014, we launched our first three Focus Areas in Health, Economic Development, and Safety and Justice. </p>

		<p>Within the Health Focus Area, we use the term health as a community outcome that is deeply affected by a communities lived environment, and the enrollment, usability, and delivery of digital services, especially for the safety net. We take an expansive view of the local agencies and services that contribute to this outcome, but typically work with Health Departments, Human Service Agencies, Public Health Agencies, and the organizations that deliver government funded health services such as public hospitals and clinics, and non profits like the Food Bank. </p>
