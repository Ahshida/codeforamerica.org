A successful engagement strategy requires defining your audience and having clear goals about which constituenecies you are trying to reach. After identifying any unheard voices or underrepresented groups, you can work towards bringing them into your outreach process and surfacing their opinions. This is important for collecting feedback that is both inclusive and represntative of your community's demographics. Clearly defining your intended audience upfront allows you to more objectively assess whether or not your engagement process had its intended impact. 

###Getting Started

1. **Understand your community's composition**. The primary goal of your engagement strategy should be to reach a representative sample of your community. Free tools like [Census Reporter](http://censusreporter.org/) pull data from the Census Bureau and visualize key socio-economic indicators in an easy to understand way. 

2. **Assess the effectiveness of your outreach to date**. If you've collected any data during your engagement process to date, compare these numbers against Census data to idetnify any gaps. We suggest using over/under thresholds to see where you might be underrepresented or oversampling.  

Any communities that are underrepresented in your outreach should become priority groups for your future work. Focus on your biggest gaps first.

If you aren't yet meausuring the reach of your engagement efforts, here's a few simple ways to start surveying who is in the room and is being represented: 

* **Sticky dot exercise**. During a public meeting, make posterboards with key demographic categories you are sampling. Have dot stickers available for the people to place on the boards to show what groups they identify with.

* **Paper surveys**. 
* **On-line surveys**. 
* **Clicker surveys**. 

3. **Build relationships with key community groups**. 
4. **Measure on-going progress of your engagement strategy**.
