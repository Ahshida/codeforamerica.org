<h1>Code for America Fellowship Toolkit </h1>

<p class="alert">This toolkit documents the Code for America (CfA) Fellowship program within the U.S. with a focus on the strategies we use. We hope that it will serve as a helpful reference to support those in other countries and in the U.S. who are interested in forming their own innovation Fellowships. The following is a living document serving anyone with the desire to replicate or remix parts of our program for their own purposes. This document was originally produced in collaboration by CfA staff: International Programs Manager, Lynn Fine, and Fellowship Program Manager, Alexander Tran. This resource was last updated in January 2015. </p>



<h2>I. WELCOME // BIENVENIDO // CIAO </h2>

<p>If you are looking to start a civic technology innovation program like CfA’s<a href= "http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/">Fellowship </a>program, then you are in the right place.  This toolkit was mainly written to be used by local community groups who want to run “Code for”-style programs, but many of the lessons outlined in this toolkit are also relevant for those of you who work in government and want to bring an innovation Fellowship to your community.</p>

<p><b>This is not your average toolkit.</b> What “works” in the United States won’t necessarily work everywhere, and what works in one context doesn’t necessarily work in another. This toolkit aims to take you on an analytical journey to determine the best way for you to make a difference in your own community using modern principles of design, technology, and social change. This toolkit does not intend to serve as a turnkey solution. In this spirit, we will ask you questions that will help you to evaluate different program options and provide you with a detailed account of how we run our Fellowship program. We will outline our own processes, the reasoning behind them, and provide you with some strategies we’ve found useful. We invite you to mix and match however you see fit and encourage you to<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forms/d/1j09kdqiwi9JRKFwfWX4pUAxmaFyXanRNBCqGU3E78rs/viewform"> share your own experience</a> which we will use to improve this resource.</p>


<h2>II. INTRODUCTION TO CODE FOR AMERICA’S FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM </h2>

<p>To provide some context, here’s the backstory outlining <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2011/09/30/were-two/">how CfA began</a>, eloquently penned in a blog post by the organization’s founder, Jennifer Pahlka. CfA’s Fellowship Program is a year-long public service program in which civic-minded developers, designers, activists, and product managers are grouped into three-person teams. These teams are each paired with a government partner (normally from a city) from different parts of the U.S. Fellows work out of the CfA office in San Francisco to develop solutions to problems facing their  government partners, using technology.

<p>Fellows and the government staff in their partner cities work together to build apps, foster new approaches to problem solving throughout government, and tackle community issues. In the past, teams have worked on improving access to social services, identifying alternatives to incarceration, and civic engagement, among others. You can learn more about past projects <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Fellowship began as CfA's flagship program. Today, it continues to help us learn about the inner workings of government and try out projects that can help governments use digital technology to deliver better services to residents. These learnings inform work in our more scaled programs such as the Brigade and the creation of resources and trainings.</p>

<h2>III. GUIDING QUESTIONS</h2>
<h3>Should you run a Fellowship program (in your country)?<h3>
<p>There are a lot of factors that make it more likely for a CfA-style Fellowship program to succeed. Before running a CfA-inspired Fellowship program, we encourage you to ask yourself the following questions. They should help you decide if it makes sense to run a Fellowship program or if other approaches would be more effective. </p>

<p>Questions to ask yourself:<p>
 
 <ol>
<li>Is there a robust developer community where you live? Enough people with technology skills (ideally young people in their late twenties or so) to make recruiting Fellows possible? If you’re unsure how to determine this it could be helpful to research private sector tech companies or see if there is a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">CfA Brigade</a> CfA’s international citizen volunteer program) group where you live.</li>

<li>Would people from your technology community be interested in dedicating their time for a year of service? If you’re not sure, go to some tech events or ask around at tech companies and other organizations.</li>

<li>Is there a local government office that is particularly interested in working to find technology solutions to service delivery challenges or to foster civic engagement?</li>

<li>Does your government have strict procurement regulations that would make “procuring Fellows” (paying a stipend to Fellows) difficult? You can learn more about procurement <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/procurement/">here</a>.</li>

<p>If yes to above, are there any workarounds to this such as a formal internship or government Fellowship program through which the government could pay for Fellows?</p>

<li>Would your government be willing to pay/have the resources to support this kind of program?</li>

<p>If there are governments that don’t have funds but are interested in the program, are there other possible funding sources? Corporate social responsibility programs? Foundations? See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1Uc8cmQt9-c4DaMD0hvamQwG6cOxNtjFO5Mq6dcdQ9_o/edit#">fundraising resource guide</a> we created for CfA’s Brigades for some ideas. Please note that the Fellowship program generally requires a hefty time commitment from technologists who sign up as Fellows. In our experience, paying Fellows is key to fostering commitment and acquiring a large talent pool for recruiting. </p>

</ol>

<p>If you have answered “NO” to any of the questions outlined above, you might want to consider <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/">other program alternatives</a> before moving forward with a CfA-style Fellowship program. If you have answered yes to these questions, a tailored variation of the CfA Fellowship Program will likely be best instead of trying to do exactly what we do for our Fellowship program. </p>

<p>For example, our Fellowship program works with multiple city governments at the same time throughout the year. Fellows do not live in the cities with which they are paired, but work from CfA’s offices in San Francisco and travel to and from their partner cities about four times a year. This gives Fellowship teams the opportunity to share ideas with other Fellows and draw upon CfA office staff for consistent support and access to mentors who come through our offices. But it also limits collaboration between Fellows and city government partners and has other drawbacks. This model might not make sense in a smaller country or if there aren’t enough resources to cover travel costs for Fellowship teams to frequently visit their government partners. </p>

<p>Some groups have run <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/">Fellowship programs where Fellows lived in their partner cities</a>. This provided lots of opportunities for community organizing and user research. We encourage you to take what works from our model, leave what doesn’t and create the rest (and then share back your learnings with the <a href="http://codeforall.org/">rest of the civic technology community!</a>).  See examples of variations other groups have done <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>V. RECRUITING FELLOWS</h2>

<h3>Strategies for Recruiting Quality Fellows</h3>

<p>Paying fellows sub-market wages makes it difficult to lure candidates away from their high-paying jobs in the tech sector. It is also often hard for candidates to voluntarily uproot their lives and relocate to San Francisco for the Fellowship experience, especially if they have families or community ties. However, we are continually amazed at the quality of the candidates we accept and their ability to innovate in local government. We believe this is in large part thanks to the following recruitment strategies.</p>

<h4>Recruitment Strategies<h4>
<p class="alert" This <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/presentation/d/1YUEvgW9bWCvbaQjrdo-SNVVRUhzsqtyFJwt9pgrxL5s/edit#slide=id.p14">recruitment deck</a> was used at the Harvard Kennedy School to share how the Fellowship program works and some sample projects that fellows work on. </p>

<h5>Messaging</h5>
<p>One question we often get is: how do you frame the Fellowship as a worthwhile opportunity? How do you brand it as cool and worthy of sacrificing the high-paying salaries that potential fellows would get from working in the private tech-sector instead?</p>

<p>Generating buzz and clout around the organization and the program helps to get applicants excited about applying. It’s also really important to reiterate the message that the fellows are joining a community of people who are committed to making a difference. It’s important to appeal to people sense of civic duty by highlighting the opportunity to make a difference and be a part of a bigger network of changemakers. This is especially effective when mentors, staff, and your organization’s larger network lend their credibility to the organization and actively commit to helping fellows continue to do similar work once the Fellowship is over. Highlighting the opportunities for learning during the Fellowship is also a very effective approach.</p>

<p>Getting quality candidates to apply and building the program’s credibility can be very challenging at first. We’ve broken down our strategy into a few key parts: high level press, grassroots communication, and high touch engagements. </p>

<h5>High-level Press</h5>

<p>No matter the size of the population of the community you’re serving, there are bound to be media outlets: TV stations, blogs, radio programs, community gatherings, and listservs that would love to do a story about an event, launch, initiative, or campaign you are creating. Even if the event is only loosely affiliated with the Fellowship program, you can still use this as a chance to promote the program. It’s especially helpful to get someone high profile to pitch the story for you.</p>

<p>We typically develop relationships with both national and local press outlets to pitch stories. We create press releases, share stories with local press and/or local leaders who would be willing to share our message. (See a sample press release from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYHBMkubufM-Y-FSaHNby6WseXfctzuvlzYRz7WH-OA/edit">Code for America’s Fellowship announcement</a>). We also create a list of key, trusted press members who can help get the message out. They especially appreciate it when you give them the “scoop” ahead of time. Don’t be afraid to cold call!</p>

<p>Here are some examples of high level press we’ve generated over the years directed at recruitment. In 2012, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNU1pWSU5HZnB1TjQ/edit">this CNN piece</a> interviewing our founder, Jennifer Pahlka, focused on the genesis of the program. In 2014, we collaborated on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNY1hwZF8tSzdrakU/edit">this smaller piece</a> in FCW News to promote the program to government technology officials who might be eligible to join the Fellowship program. <p>

<h5>Grassroots Communication</h5>

<p>Over the years we’ve built up a sizeable mailing list which we use to spread the word about the Fellowship. Like any social change organization, we grew our list over time. As of June 2014, we have over 14.5k subscribers and use <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">“Mailchimp”</a> for mass mailings. </p>

<p>Here’s an example email we sent to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1-3POEes1u3aLjKC0xflnd_k-HHnNrlWu53GyP_1pemE/edit">followers on our email list</a>. </p>

<p><b>Here are some resources that you could re-purpose for your own efforts:</b></p>
<ul>

<p>If you haven’t already built up a network to help you get the word out, the open source technology community in your area can be a great resource, as can partnering with community organizations (such as churches, libraries or non-profits) and enlisting governments in your area to use their media channels to help you get the word out. </p>

<h5>High-Touch Events & Initiatives</h5>

<p>Both of the approaches outlined above have been equally important in getting the word out about our Fellowship. We’ve also used personal recommendations and relationships to drum up interest.These include:</p>

</figure>
<p>

<p>Here are some strategies you can use: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hold events and invite high-profile guests:</b> Host gatherings and events at your offices (or at someone else’s, CfA borrowed many other people’s office spaces before we had our own and often holds events at tech companies’ offices to this day). Most of our mentors are from the government and tech space, and come to our events either as speakers, participants, or in a mentorship capacity. Some of them also serve on our board or on various advisory councils we have. This took CfA years to build up but once we had a couple of high profile people who were very respected in both the tech and gov communities on board it helped us to galvanize interest from others. </li>

<li><b>Leverage your inner network.</b> Advisors and mentors to your organization may take various forms, but if you can leverage them for recruitment, it can really help you create buzz around the program (a tweet, a post or a phone call on behalf of these figures are all great ways to get the word out). This way, you build high profile champions who can back your cause across many platforms and can reach out to their own networks in support of your efforts. </li>

<li><b>Engage your staff.</b> Drawing upon the resources within your own staff can be really effective too, especially at attracting targeted audiences (such as the tech community in your region). Our own CfA tech team did some great work in 2014 telling stories and sharing projects from previous Fellowship classes. In those cases, they went to local tech companies and shared the Fellowship opportunity with that organization and any guests that that organization invited. Many of CfA's international partners have given examples from CfA or other civic organizations that were farther along to paint a picture of what success looks like and of how much fun it could be to get involved. Going to conferences and sharing learnings is also a good way to spread the word. </li>

<li><b>Use regional connections.</b> CfA is lucky to be located in San Francisco and is able to draw from Silicon Valley for candidates. However, we have to leverage regional networks to attract tech talent from all corners of the United States of America. Our top candidates, who typically both have the skills and the passion to make lasting contributions in our space, also typically come from referrals from within our existing network or partner organizations affiliated with our work. This information guides our recruitment process. </li>
</ul>

<p class="alert" <b>Templates for recruitment </b>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1ptgrXFnF9wrqMhZqSvnvkUhGPWMbCr5oi4JdzYH-pBk/edit">Sample Tweets</b></a>: This document contains sample tweets, job descriptions, and an email signature staff can put in their emails to help recruit people. </li>

<li>Facebook Campaign: Use Facebook or a comparable social network to get people interested in the Fellowship. At CfA, we had staff and Fellows post to Facebook/Instagram about “Why They CfA: with an image of them holding up a sign they wrote around our office, and it generated a lot of buzz. </li>

<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/70212611"><b>Code for Mexico City Government Recruitment Video</a></b>: This video was used to get people from Mexico excited about Mexico City Government’s first Fellowship program.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In addition to getting the word out, a big part of Fellowship recruitment is about easing the concern of candidates. The two main concerns we encounter are: 1. I’m scared I won’t be able to find a job post-Fellowship; and 2. I’m worried about relocating. </p>

<p>In response to the first concern we:</p>

<p><b>Offer great networking benefits</b>: CfA provides access to a network of dedicated civic tech professionals and leaders that inspire our work and provide possible career connections for Fellows once the program is complete. We work to connect our Fellows with leaders in civic startups, thought leaders like Tim O’Reilly, government leaders (2013 fellow Laura Meixell now <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNTExPYXFSZmZad1E/edit">works as a data and strategy manager</a> for the government of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and more. </b>

<p>In response to the second concern we:</p>

<p><b>Provide logistical support</b>: CfA allocates staff time to supporting Fellows’ relocation and pre-orientation. We take care of the small stuff like getting them a public transportation card, giving them suggestions for housing and lists of local resources. </p>

<h5>Team Formation </h5>

<p>CfA seeks a diverse Fellowship class at both the team level (Fellows are grouped into teams of three) and within the entire cohort (the entire Fellowship class is approximately 30 Fellows). Each team is treated like a very early stage startup in terms of skill needs. We try to make sure each team has development talent (both backend, frontend, database skills, data science), design talent (user experience, graphic design, design thinking, etc.), and people skills (project management, product management, community engagement, content development, and more.)</p>

<p>Within CfA, we work very hard to foster a culture of collaboration within the cohort because no single team of three is guaranteed to have all the skills they need on their own to develop a finished product. </p>

<p>Some examples of the specific skills we look for can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/presentation/d/1ze5p79dQACvAnsUv5pQakCjIpC8d7oiGWrWWNEp4s-0/edit#slide=id.p16">this deck</a> that we prepared for the Mexico City government when they started a Fellowship program. You can also see a breakdown of data on where our total applicants come from and their skills in <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/08/01/2014_fellows_applications/">this blog post</a>. </p>

<h5>Diversity</h5>

<p>Diversity means something different to everyone, but what we mean by diversity when we talk about it in the context of the CfA Fellowship is that we expect the program to respect people from all walks of life, and that the Fellowship class should reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. </p>

<p>We look for a diversity of skillsets and professional backgrounds that match the needs of our projects. We also actively reach out during our Fellows recruitment process to those who are traditionally less prevalent in the tech sector, such as women, racial minorities, and those of diverse sexual orientations, among others. </p>

<p>We at CfA believe that the richer the diversity of a group, the more perspectives available to draw upon. This is very valuable to the work that we do.</p>
