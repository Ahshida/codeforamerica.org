This guide explains what metrics you need to measure to work out how your city website is performing. You'll need to monitor these metrics to make sure your website is efficient and providing value for money. By regularly examining these metrics, you'll be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your city website and find ways to improve it.

## What you will  measure

### Core key performance indicators

#### Cost per transaction

#### User satisfaction

#### Completion rate

#### Digital take-up


#### Service availability

 - Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time
 - Monitor system performance in real-time (e.g. response time, latency, throughput, and error rates)

Use data to drive decisions

At every stage of a project, we should measure how well our service is working for our users. This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with it in real-time. Our teams and agency leadership should carefully watch these metrics to find issues and identify which bug fixes and improvements should be prioritized. Along with monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly.

 - Ensure monitoring can measure median, 95th percentile, and 98th percentile performance
 - Create automated alerts based on this monitoring
 - Track concurrent users in real-time, and monitor user behaviors in the aggregate to determine how well the service meets user needs
 - Publish metrics internally
 - Publish metrics externally
 - Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production
