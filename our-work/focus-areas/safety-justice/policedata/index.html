  <h2>About the Police Open Data Census</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>The Police Open Data Census compiles currently available open datasets about police interactions with citizens in the US, including Use of Force, Officer-Involved Shootings, and Complaints Against Police. The Police Open Data Census was built with the city of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/indianapolis/" target="_blank">Indianapolis</a> in partnership with the White House Police Data Initiative to better understand policing challenges. The Police Open Data Census also helps communities identify actions they can take to improve law enforcement and community engagement. The data—presented in an easy to access and understand format—can help city residents, community groups, researchers, and journalists better understand neighborhood policing and engage with police and community leaders.</p>

  <h2>The Product</h2>
<div class="layout-minim">
  <p>With the available data, the system can provide historical information going back decades, as well as near real-time data about the current jail population. It also allows judges and officials to see trends and the broad picture while simultaneously being able to drill down to the names and information of individual inmates. Features enable stakeholders to: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>visualize and compare the existing capacity of the jail and of  alternatives to incarceration programs</li>
  <li>track who is where, across the entire jail population</li>  
  <li>understand population trends, as well as filter the data by gender, age, court, sentence status or length of stay</li>
  <li>use any devise to access the software with its responsive design</li> 
  </ul>
