		<h4>As a working group member, we ask that you:</h4>
		<p>Two designated staff members to participate in the Procurement working group. Both participants will be expected to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Participate in 2-3 preparatory phone calls with CfA staff and/or advisors before September 2014 to help us understand needs and priorities around procurement in your municipality</li>
				<li>Engage in 1-2 collaborative virtual roundtables with other cities to share ideas, give feedback, and learn from each other's approaches.</li>
				<li>Attend the CfA Summit in September and participate in 2-3 hours of working sessions on procurement</li>
			</ul>
		<p>These are just minimum participation expectations â€” we hope to work closely with our working group partners to go above and beyond what's listed here.</p>
