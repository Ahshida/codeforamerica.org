  <h2>About the Police Open Data Census</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>Originally built with the city of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/indianapolis/" target="_blank">Indianapolis</a> in partnership with the White House Police Data Initiative to better understand specific policing challenges and help communities identify actions they can take to improve law enforcement and enhance community engagement. The data, presented in a format that is easy to access and understand â€“ can help city residents, community groups, researchers, and journalists better understand what policing looks like in neighborhoods, and engage with police and community leaders on pressing issues.</p>
    <p>Presidential Innovation Fellow, and co-organizer of the White House Police Data Initiative writes about <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/05/17/5-ways-to-jumpstart-the-release-of-open-data-on-policing/" target="_blank">5 Ways to Jumpstart the Release of Open Data on Policing</a>.</p>

  <h2>The Product</h2>
<div class="layout-minim">
  <p>With the available data, the system can provide historical information going back decades, as well as near real-time data about the current jail population. It also allows judges and officials to see trends and the broad picture while simultaneously being able to drill down to the names and information of individual inmates. Features enable stakeholders to: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>visualize and compare the existing capacity of the jail and of  alternatives to incarceration programs</li>
  <li>track who is where, across the entire jail population</li>  
  <li>understand population trends, as well as filter the data by gender, age, court, sentence status or length of stay</li>
  <li>use any devise to access the software with its responsive design</li> 
  </ul>
