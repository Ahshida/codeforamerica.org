			<h2>Join Us to Improve Procurement</h2>

			<p>Government purchasing rules have fallen out of step with the pace at which technology now improves, and make it difficult for government to access the most current and relevant tools available.</p>
			<p>Cities and counties around the country are tackling this issue — by piloting new models that give governments more control over the purchasing process, more flexibility in terms of options, and bring new vendors into the ecosystem, while still providing important protections against fraud and abuse.</p>
			<p>We’re looking for more cities to lead the way. Join Code for America's working group to be part of a nationwide cohort of cities and counties who are reimagining procurement for the 21st century.</p>

			<h2>First Steps</h2>
		</div>
		<p>By creating improvements to local procurement policies and processes, cities can support investment in local businesses and startups, break down barriers to entry for new firms offering innovative products and services that address civic needs, and access a wider pool of potential solutions and providers that offer cost savings and efficiencies.</p>
		<p>Anyone can take these first steps today to start making progress towards improving procurement.
			<ul>
				<li>Talk to stakeholders in your city about procurement improvement. Use these talking points to start.</li>
				<li>Make information about opportunities to work with the city more accessible to local businesses and entrepreneurs. Create a website and a structured data feed listing small-dollar opportunities below the procurement threshold that local entrepreneurs might not otherwise be aware of.</li>
				<li>Help us visualize the procurement landscape around the country. Add your city’s basic procurement information to Code for America’s map.
				</li>
				<li>Check out existing tools to improve the process.
					<ul>
						<li>Screendoor.io</li>
						<li>SmartProcure is free for government and offers purchase order data to bring greater transparency to procurement.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Learn how other cities around the world are taking on this issue. Read our case studies of six different efforts that could be adapted for your local context.</li>

			<h3 class="wodge-header">Kansas City, Missouri: Innovation Partnership</h3>
			<img src="http://placehold.it/195x130" class="wodge-image" />
				<div class="wodge-text">
					<p>Enacted through the Administrative Code, Kansas City established the Innovation Partnerships program within city government to formalize support for the local startup community when engaging with the government procurement process. This is accomplished by providing a specific point of contact, feedback on contracts and guidance on proposal submissions, and developing new processes and tools to make the procurement process more accessible to smaller companies, such as developing prequalification standards.</p>

    			<h3>Ready to adapt one of these approaches in your city?</h3>
		</div>
		<p>Here are some patterns we’ve observed that worked in other cities to keep in mind as you get started on any procurement improvement initiative. We encourage you to join the Code for America working group so that we can support your efforts.</p>
		<h4>Bring the right people at the table.</h4>
		<p>Key stakeholders, including representatives from the office of the city attorney and the procurement department, should be involved in any efforts from the beginning. Getting their buy-in and input early will help ensure you’re able to get the traction you need to create lasting change. Depending on your goals, you will likely want to involve other departmental stakeholders who have a vested interest in the procurement process.</p>
		<p><em>Recommendation: Set up regular meetings (e.g. monthly) with relevant staff members and quarterly meetings in a committee structure to (1) identify shared issues in procurement, and (2) develop a collaborative vision around common goals.</em></p>
