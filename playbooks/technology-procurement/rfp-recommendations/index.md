## What works

One of the most successful approaches of changing how government purchases technology has been the work done by the United Kingdom’s [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) (GDS) since 2011. GDS’ work has inspired the creation of the [United States Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) (USDS) and [18f](https://18f.gsa.gov/) in America and New Zealand’s [Department of Internal Affairs](https://www.govt.nz/about).  

This guide is a brief overview of how successful government technology is being delivered in 2015. 

### 1. Government for the people means meeting user needs

Technology in government works when it delivers what its users need, not what government thinks its users need. Real and tested user needs - not requirements drawn up in isolation, in response to policy - help government discover what is needed to deliver a successful service. 

#### Starting with user needs
In delivering government services, meeting user needs means identifying and thinking about real users and what they need - whether those users are residents, citizens or government staff. Teams must thoroughly understand what users really need - whether it’s claiming SNAP or WIC benefits, licensing a childcare facility or starting a new business. 

#### User research is important
One of the biggest factors for success we have seen has been developing a true user research capability. Note that we do not say user testing, because invariably testing comes after development and does not a core focus of discovering, validating and meeting real user needs. 

#### Services, not solutions
Bad government technology projects can usually be described as policy-led searches for complete solutions. Instead, government has a higher chance of successfully delivering technology if the focus is on delivering a service to users instead of a solution that will solve a problem, no matter how detailed the description of the problem. 


### 2. Letting digital leaders lead

#### Digital Directors
Strong digital executive leadership is needed for technology to work. Governments that have succeeded have appointed Digital Directors with absolute authority over the delivery of digital services and digital spending. These directors are  fully supported by, and part of, the executive to lead change. 

#### Simpler governance
Digital leadership also needs simpler governance. In the UK, the Office of the Chief Technology Officer has [simplified](https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/29/better-for-less/) existing boards, committees and relationships into four areas: Mission IT, Digital Public Services, Infrastructure and Shared Services to re-focus on outcomes and escape process loops. 

#### Product owners with authority
Finally, internal teams succeed when they have ownership of the services they oversee. 

The USDS [recommends](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play6) that government services have a single Product Owner with the authority to make product, business and technical decisions, and ultimate accountability; GDS calls product owners[Service Managers](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html), who work throughout central government, departments and agencies, each with the authority to manage and direct the services they're responsible for. 

### 3. Using the right methods, at the right time, for the right problems

Successful governments are delivering digital services with an assortment of methods that fit the work that needs to be done. These governments recognize that digital service delivery is an intrinsic part of 21st century government and use methods that allow them to retain ownership and control of the user’s experience. 

#### Build or commission: in-house, agile and iterative
Where problems are not clearly defined and new user-centered services (or replacements for legacy services) are being delivered, an in-house agile or iterative, build or commission model helps deliver working software into the hands of users quickly and frequently with the capacity to make repeated adjustments in response to feedback. Agile and iterative development is best-suited to such early stages where user needs are being continually researched and refined. 

#### Rent: established commercial off-the-shelf products
Where there are more mature products available like payment services that must “just work”, governments can take advantage of economy of scale by using off-the-shelf products. It doesn’t make sense for governments to replicate accepting payments: government should concentrate on what only government can do. Renting these types of commercial off-the-shelf products from specialists allows governments to use lean methods of management to improve efficiency and performance. 

#### Use: commodities and utilities
Finally, where products and services are at their most mature and innovation is not required (or, even undesirable), they can be treated like commodities and utilities, like consumables, water and power and more recently cloud hosting. In these cases, government can use techniques like Six Sigma to ensure quality. 

18f has written blog posts about [open source software that has reached utility/commodity status](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/11/26/how-to-use-more-open-source/) and [avoiding the waterfall process](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/22/avoiding-cloudfall/) when moving a service to the cloud. 

Purchasing decision makers and leaders must understand the difference between these three methods and where they are most appropriate. Digital services that work are being delivered by understanding when and where in a service to use agile, lean and six Sigma techniques and when and what to build, rent or buy - and not a one-size-fits-all approach. 

Alex Holmes, Deputy Director and Chief of Staff of the UK government’s Office of the CTO, has written a [blog post explaining the benefits of “multi-sourcing”](https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/18/knocking-down-the-towers-of-siam/). The UK government’s approach relies on internal teams knowing what services are needed to meet their users’ needs. Accountability and the architecture of a service rests with this internal team. These teams are then able to design and own overall services, or own services, design and implement them and work with a service integrator and manager for day-to-day running of the service. 

### 4. Build internal teams to own services

In America, the USDS recommends [bringing in experienced teams](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play7); in the UK, these teams are called [multidisciplinary teams](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team). 

These teams have all the understanding and ability they need to design, own and implement user-centered, iteratively developed services. Not all of these team members are government staff - successful digital services are delivered in this way by using vendors, too. But the key is that government must be in control, not a vendor. 

### 5. Recognizing digital as basic part of government

All of this is additive. Government leaders must accept that digital is an inextricable part of how government is and must be delivered in the 21st century. The internet and cheap computing - that keeps getting cheaper - have massively changed society over the past twenty five years. 

Because of this, government cannot treat “digital” as something separate. It is not something that can be bought, installed or specified as a solution or a service. Responsibility for digital delivery can’t be the job of one person, team or department. It must be something that government at all levels must understand and be capable of delivering. 

This is nothing short of digital transformation of government, of improving the way government delivers its services to its users by putting digital delivery at the center. 

Denver, Colorado’s [Peak Academy](http://www.denvergov.org/mayor/MayorsOffice/ProgramsInitiatives/DenverPeakPerformance/PeakAcademy/tabid/444380/Default.aspx) is performing part of this transformation by training city employees in “lean” management principles that will help them reduce waste. In the UK, the Department for Work and Pensions embarked on a [Digital Academy](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/24/the-digital-academy-1-year-on-and-going-strong/) program to digitally transform and train its entire organization - an ambitious program for a department that serves 22 million users.
