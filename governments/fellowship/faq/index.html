                <p>The Fellowship program sends teams of technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials. The fellows apply 21st Century Government Principles to important problems, focused on health, economic development, and safety and justice.</p>
                
                <p>City applications for the Fellowship open in January and close March 31.</p>

                <p><h4>Eligibility and Selection Criteria</h4>
<p>We are looking for US-based cities and counties who are interested in working on projects focused on health, economic development, and/or safety and justice. Selected government partners exhibit strong leadership, are committed to providing support to the Fellows, and will work on a plan to sustain the work after the Fellowship ends. If you are not based in the USA, please visit the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/about/international">International Page</a>.</p>

        
        <h4>Who are the Fellows?</h4>
<p>Fellows are highly-sought after experienced professionals with backgrounds in design, development, research, or project management. Fellows have come from Google, Apple, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/how-rackspace-supports-code-for-america-Fellows/">Rackspace</a> and NASA. To see more, check out current <a href="../../geeks/our-geeks/2015-Fellows/">2015 fellowship bios</a>.</p>


<h4>What do the fellows do?</h4>
<p>Over the course of the project period, the fellows immerse themselves in the community, researching user needs, meeting with stakeholders, proposing solutions, and collaborating with the government to build technology using an iterative, user-centered, and data-driven approach.</p>

<p>While the product of the Fellowship is typically an early stage application that improves the delivery of a government service or function, the process acts as a vehicle for driving cultural and structural change inside of government â€” encouraging innovation, improving tolerance for risk, and increasing the organizations capacity for transparency and engagement.</p>

<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
<p>The overall investment for the 2015 Fellowship is $440,000. In most cases 50% of the investment is covered by the local government applying for the Fellowship--which helps cover for direct expenses for a team of three fellows (stipend, benefits, travel, training). The other 50% is typically raised by the local government from community funders (corporations, foundations, individuals), in collaboration with Code for America, and covers the cost of administering the Fellowship program. Additional fellows placed on a team at the request of a local government require an incremental investment. To discuss funding options for your Fellowship, email <a href="mailto:luke@codeforamerica.org">luke@codeforamerica.org</a> to learn more about how we work with Fellowship applicants to secure local funding.</p>

<h4>How much government staff time is required?</h4>
<p>Project success correlates directly to staff engagement in the project. We ask that someone in a leadership position acts as the primary Fellowship contact. This person assists in briefing Fellows, defining the goals and outcomes, and engaging other government stakeholders for interviews/meetings. </p>
