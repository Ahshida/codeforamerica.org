  <h2>The Product</h2>
<div class="layout-minim">
  <p>AddressIQ is a web application that analyzes city data to help identify addresses with a high number of 911 calls and support finding cost-effective ways to provide those addresses with better care and resources. The application synthesizes and analyzes data from the fire department and the police department, cross references them with business license data, and presents the data back to City Staff. </p>
  <p>This data can't tell us about individuals, it can only tell us about addresses. The development and any findings must be framed accordingly.</p>
