      <h2>Civic Engagement</h2>
      <p>Code for America works at the intersection of <a href="/brigade/">civic engagement</a>, <a href="/about/fellowship/">government</a>, and <a href="/apps/">technology</a>.</p>
      <p>We build digital tools that improve the public’s interactions with government, and use those tools as a catalyst for structural changes that make government more open, more responsive, and more engaging.</p>
      <p>We emphasize the role of the citizen not just as a passive recipient of government services, but as an active participant in building government.</p>
      <p>We have seen glimpses of a better model of engagement working for government staff and the public across America. This Engagement Standard systematizes what we have seen work and offers both governments and residents concrete tools and tactics to use in their communities.</p>
