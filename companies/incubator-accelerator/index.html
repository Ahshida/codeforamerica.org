    <h2>Accelerator</h2>
    <p>Code for America ran a government technology Accelerator from 2012-2014.</p>
    <p>The $172 billion government IT spending market is ripe and ready for disruption. It needs new tools and technologies that provide high value at reasonable costs â€” and it needs new entrepreneurs and businesses to provide them. The Code for America Accelerator worked with govtech focused companies and entrepreneurs to do just this.</p>
    <p>The Accelerator helped early-stage govtech companies get the financial, strategic, and operational support they need to succeed. The program focused on areas such as sales, lead generation, UX, marketing, product and fundraising. These companies received 200+ hours of mentorship from industry leaders, pitched to numerous government officials and gained access to govtech investors and sales leads.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The Accelerator completely elevated our overall sense of purpose. We already knew that we were disrupting the state of technology for a specific pain point, and the Accelerator helped us realize the part we can play to transform government into a platform on which vendors like us, citizens, and public sector employees work together to improve society.</p>

    <h2>Incubator</h2>
    <p>Additionally Code for America ran an Incubator program exclusively for Fellows after their fellowship. This six month program (Dec-Jun) helped fellowship teams transition from prototype app to full fledged product-market fit. Teams worked on scaling their businesses and better navigating the govtech space. In past years, teams have received 100+ hours of mentorship from industry leaders, pitched to hundreds of government officials and gained access to numerous govtech investors and sales leads.</p>
