    <p>Vallejo has been recognized as one of the most diverse populations of any city in the United States. It was hit hard by the foreclosure crisis, and while the City Council passed the first structurally balanced budget in over a decade, Vallejo is still recovering from municipal bankruptcy. In this context of severely limited resources and reduced staff, Vallejo is partnering with Code for America to use technology and innovation to improve public safety focusing on building trust between the law enforcement and Vallejo residents.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The Code for America fellowship is an opportunity for us to enhance communication and increase engagement, and to maximize public involvement and collaboration. The City Council and I are thrilled to have been selected after having made the application to Code for America a top priority this year. We look forward to the many possibilities that will surely come from this fantastic partnership.&rdquo;</p>
