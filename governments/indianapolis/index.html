    <p>With an already established technology presence and growing startup scene, the City of Indianapolis was looking to bring a new approach to technology to City government. In particular, they saw technology as a way to increase citizen engagement through providing greater access to public safety data. With access to RMS (Report Management System), CAD (Computer-Aided Dispatch), and IA (Internal Affairs)  data sets, the city turned to Code for America for partnership and expertise in data analysis. Code for America Fellows were to explore ways in which they could combine data, technology, and public safety.

        <p>Indy’s selection for the next Code for America program provides an excellent opportunity to bring forward-thinking solutions to city government. Indy is using data in innovative ways to enhance public safety.  Our team looks forward to working with the Code for America fellows to better integrate data in our daily efforts to make Indy an even better place live and work.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>The 2015 Fellowship in Indianapolis</h2>
  </header>

<section class="layout-semibreve">

<h3>The Research</h3>
<p>Fellows spent the month of February learning about and talking with many departments within public safety. The team considered a wide range of potential projects from tracking transient and homeless children, to better prison reentry coordination between the Sheriff, community, and non-profits. Ultimately, the team decided that IMPD (Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department) was where they could have the most impact in their short year as fellows.</p>
<p>With the help of Code for America and support from a former fellow and current Presidential Innovation Fellow, the fellows and representatives from IMPD were <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/04/07/code-for-america-joins-white-house-convening-on-tech-and-community-safety/">invited to attend a convening</a> of police chiefs and other members of the law enforcement community at the White House. Indianapolis and 20 other communities raised their hand in participation of the President’s Police Data Initiative. When the city committed to opening up 3 different data sets, including officer involved shootings and use of force, the fellowship team saw a clear opportunity to use technology as the lever to start open communication between IMPD and the Indianapolis community. They spent the remainder of the year working with different resident groups, IMPD, and the Department of Public Safety translating the data and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/05/28/contribute-to-the-police-open-data-census/">exploring ways</a> to share it publically.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Over the course of a weekend in November, team Indy launched their site, <a href="http://www.projectcomport.org">Project Comport</a>. Comport is tool for law enforcement agencies to open their data and be more accountable to their citizens. The site features three major datasets: citizen complaints, uses of force, and officer involved shootings. There are two major goals of the site- first, to provide a base level of examination of the data so that people have better context to understand it, and second, to provide raw versions of cleaned, privacy conscious, data that is easy to download for those who wish to use it for further analysis.</p>
<br>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Code for America is continuing to <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/12/04/comport-open-police-data-in-indianapolis-and-beyond/">support the work</a> team Indianapolis started and planning to pilot <a href="http://www.projectcomport.org">Comport</a> with 3 more law enforcement agencies in 2016 in hopes of seeing greater police accountability and transparency throughout the US. The fellowship team saw two other major successes during their year, the start of the <a href="http://www.openindybrigade.com/">Indianapolis Brigade</a> and the opening of the <a href="https://data.indy.gov/">Indianapolis Regional Data Portal</a>. </p>
