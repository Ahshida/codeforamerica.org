	<h2>Introduction: What is open data, and why bother?</h2>
	</div>
	<p>Government data is a valuable public resource that, when accessible by every community member, can be a powerful tool to support the goals and values of the community. Cities and counties around the country are making an effort to ensure the data they hold is freely and easily available to the public by embracing and institutionalizing the practice of “open data.”</p>
	<p>What is open data? Basically, open data refers to data (such as documents, databases, records, or transcripts, including those managed by outside vendors) released by a government or organization that is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>freely available to be used, shared, and reused by anyone for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.</li>
		<li>available in digital, machine-readable formats (such as .csv) so that it can be used in combination with other data and applications.</li>
		<li>available in its entirety — and able to be downloaded “in bulk” and not just manually retrieved record-by-record.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are many benefits of opening data. By opening data in machine-readable formats, governments can:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Build new avenues for civic engagement and participation (technologists can use the data to build or deploy an existing app).</li>
		<li>Create internal efficiencies and save money by creating a centralized place those inside and outside government can easily find the information they need.</li>
		<li>Be a platform for new apps, services, and businesses to be built upon, spurring economic development.</li>
		<li>Increase transparency and trust between government and community. </li>
		<li>Make important and useful community information more accessible to residents. </li>
		<li>Reduce the burden on government staff to respond to repetitive public records requests by making frequently-requested information available to residents in a self-serve format.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These are just a few of the reasons your government might decide to pursue an open data initiative. In this guide, we’ll explain some of the practical tactics and considerations you’ll need to know to get an open data initiative off the ground in your city or county — drawing upon the experience and expertise of other governments from around the country who have successfully done so.</p>

	<h3>Laying the Groundwork for Open Data</h3>
	</div>
	<h4>Define the goals of your open data initiative</h4>
	<p>In order to be successful, open data initiatives must be clearly aligned with larger strategic goals and objectives. Opening data just for the sake of “doing open data” is a recipe for frustration, confusion, and lack of long-term impact.</p>
	<p>So, before getting started, it's key to define your goals for open data. Being clear about this from the beginning will make it easier to articulate the value and get other stakeholders on board. Ask yourself: Why is open data important for your government? What do you hope to accomplish? How can open data support the existing needs and priorities of your government and leadership?</p>
	<h4>Common goals for open data</h4>
	<p>Depending on a combination of resources, priorities, and values, cities may have any number of goals for an open data initiative. Common goals include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Increase interoperability between systems and data-driven applications within City Hall and with other jurisdictions.</li>
		<li>Save staff time and create efficiencies by increasing information sharing between departments.</li>
		<li>Provide citizens information to better understand their government's activities and participate in improving the quality of life and promoting economic development.</li>
		<li>Provide greater awareness of — and availability of — data for data-driven decision-making throughout City Hall.</li>
		<li>Seed the environment for a local civic technology ecosystem.</li>
		<li>Capitalize on applications and services built on open data standards in other cities.</li>
		<li>Increase communication and demonstrate openness to build citizens’ trust in government.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Aligning it with organizational goals and priorities</h4>
	<p>Showing how open data can drive progress on high-priority issues can help generate initial buy-in from leadership, establish quick wins, and generate momentum to get a longer-term open data initiative off the ground. When crafting your rationale for open data, you should consider how open data can strategically support high-level policy priorities specific to your local context — such as creating jobs, reducing vacant and abandoned properties, or increasing government transparency. You might want to review recent high-profile speeches from your city’s leadership, such as an annual State of the City address, to identify key issues.</p>
	<p>Be creative and push your thinking about how open data could have an impact in unexpected areas. For example, in Boston, Mayor Menino stated in his 2012 State of the City address that he wanted to the improve school selection process for families. Using open data, the city then <a href="http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-1/open-data-and-open-discource-at-boston-public-schools/">built a simple web interface</a> to help parents easily see what schools their child was eligible for and compare them on a range of dimensions like test scores, after-school programs offered, and travel time from their home.</p>
	<h4>What to expect: How open data has worked for cities of all sizes</h4>
	<p>There’s a way to do open data on any budget. Cities and counties with populations (and budgets) of all sizes have launched successful open data initiatives. The strategy and structure you choose to pursue should be informed by an understanding of your government’s resources, political environment, and priorities. Cost, demands on staff time, technology needs, and team structure can vary widely.</p>
	<p>Other cities have paved the way and can serve as a model for what to expect as you launch your own open data initiative. Here are some examples of how other cities have done it, told by the government staff who made it happen.</p>

	<h4>Build departmental support and executive buy-in</h4>
	<p>A sustainable long-term open data initiative requires cooperation between multiple departmental stakeholders, and support from executive leadership to put resources towards open data. The next step to creating a successful open data initiative is to get buy-in within city hall. You’ll want to start by identifying a small group of supporters who can be the initial champions, and gradually work to build momentum and consensus more broadly. Every city’s internal structure and circumstances are different — there’s no “one size fits all” method to getting political support for open data — but here are some general guidelines to get you started.</p>
	<h4>Who needs to be at the table?</h4>
	<div class="alert-info"><p><strong>Executive leadership:</strong> A successful open data project often involves coordination and cooperation between multiple city departments; having support from City leadership can help ensure the project receives enough resources to be successful. Depending on your city, this might be the Mayor, City Manager, or another executive team member. The executive leadership advocate should be high enough up in the organization to help resolve differences between departments and agencies if they arise (and they probably will!).</p></div>
	<div class="alert-info"><p><strong>Internal champion:</strong> In addition to executive leadership level sponsorship, it’s important to have a mid-level “boots on the ground” advocate who is invested in driving the open data initiative forward. This internal champion should serve as point person for questions, help define processes and coordinate stakeholders, and support the departmental representatives during the rollout process. Ideally, they will host weekly or bi-weekly “Open Data Office Hours” where folks from other departments can come to for help.</p>
<p>There’s no "ideal" job title for this person -- in other cities, it has been anyone from the Chief Technology Officer to a communications manager to Open Government Specialist. The important thing is their commitment to making sure the open data initiative succeeds. If you’re reading this guide, the internal champion might be you.</p></div>
	<div class="alert-info"><p><strong>IT leader:</strong> Because an open data project can involve changes to the administration of existing data-based workflows, data storage repositories, etc., close cooperation of an expert on your municipality’s data infrastructure is essential.</p></div>
	<div class="alert-info"><p><strong>GIS Specialist:</strong> A great deal of  municipal data is place-based, tied to a specific geographic location.  Having the assistance of a GIS specialist can ensure that data is provided to users in a useful format (e.g., interactive online maps are more helpful to the general public than downloads of raw GIS data files) and that geographic data is accurate.</p></div>
	<div class="alert-info"><p><strong>Departmental Stakeholders:</strong> Even if your open data initiative is being driven by members of the IT department, getting support from multiple departments across City Hall who own the data you want to release is critical to success (more on prioritizing data for release later). A supportive departmental representative can help spur adoption of open data publication initiatives within their department and while also providing valuable subject matter expertise to the leaders of the city-wide open data project.</p></div>
	
	<p>Here's some tips for getting departmental stakeholders on board with open data:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Explain direct benefits to the department (“we’ll reduce the number of citizen calls requesting this information”)</li>
		<li>Assuage fears (“the goal is to increase services provided while reducing costs, but without reducing headcount”)</li>
		<li>Point out opportunities for increased innovation and efficiency (“your rainfall report will be automatically sent to the Water Department and the Street Maintenance Department”)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>One tactic is to prepare department-specific handouts for the director and leadership of each city department. The handout should specify examples of the types of data that department might publicize and included examples of applications and services built on similar data in other cities.  Demonstrating examples of successful projects can help persuade decision-makers to get on board with the plan.</p>

	<h2>Opening and Publishing Data</h3>
	</div>
	<h3>Prioritizing data for release</h3>
	<p>Where should you start? We suggest starting small: focusing on a few key datasets for your initial release and ensuring that there is a sustainable publishing process in place, rather than doing a huge one-time data dump that will be hard to keep up to date. Former Philadelphia Chief Data Officer Mark Headd <a href="http://www.socrata.com/blog/national-day-civic-hacking-2014-live-blog/">recommends</a> starting with the "Three Bs": Buses (transit data), Bullets (crime data), and Bucks (budget and expenditure data).</p>
	<p>As your open data initiative matures, you can (and should) continually reevaluate and add more data at a later point.</p>
	<h3>Eighteen recommended datasets</h3>
	<p>Code for America, in collaboration with the Sunlight Foundation and Open Knowledge Foundation, has identified eighteen of the most important datasets that we recommend every municipality publish. Of course, you might not be ready to release all of these right away, but it’s a good place to start. View the full list <a href="http://us-city.census.okfn.org/faq/">here</a>.</p>
	<h3>Other ways to prioritize</h3>
	<p>Here are some other ways to identify high-priority datasets to release.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Start with your goals: First of all, you should return to the goals you outlined for your open data initiative. Which datasets will be most conducive to achieving your goals?</li>
		<li>Look for low-hanging fruit: What data sets would be easiest to release? Perhaps some departments already publish certain data online (as PDFs, shapefiles, spreadsheets, or other formats) that would be easy to aggregate in the open data catalog. These can be low-barrier fodder to get your open data catalog up and running, and help build momentum to open up more data later.</li>
		<li>...And quick wins: There are many free, open-source apps that are built to use open municipal data . By prioritizing the release of data sets that can be used by these existing apps, you can demonstrate the immediate tangible benefits of open data to citizens and city staff. For example, by publishing the location of storm drains or fire hydrants in your city, you can fairly easily stand up the Adopta application, making it simple for the average citizen to use and consume that data in a way that’s relevant to them. See <a href="#utility">this section</a> for other examples of apps using municipal data.</li>
		<li>Look for existing demand: Examine city website traffic and public records requests to see what data is most often sought out by the public. By making the most-often requested datasets easily available in an open format, you can satisfy public demand and alleviate burdens on departments who frequently have to supply the same information over and over again.</li>
		<li>Ask the public what they want: The public, in particular your local civic hacker community, likely has ideas about what data would be the most valuable and useful to them. Invite citizens to suggest data sets for publication by conducting a survey or requesting input via social media or tools like Mindmixer or Textizen. This in no way obligates you to publish the requested data, but it can be useful information when deciding what data to prioritize.</li>
		<li>Take cues from other cities: Many US municipalities, large and small, have launched open data catalogs over the last few years. Take a look at their open data catalogs to see what the most viewed or most downloaded of their data sets are.</li>
		<li>Include data resources from parent jurisdictions (county, state, federal): Your local data platform might be a local citizen’s first entry into the open data world -- so include links to locally-relevant data sets available in other jurisdictions, such as the federal Census tract maps and data for your city.  Check out data.gov and your state’s open data catalog for geographically-targeted data that your citizens might find useful.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> The Open Data Handbook includes other useful tips on <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/en/how-to-open-up-data/choose-datasets.html">how to choose datasets</a> to include.</p>
	 <h3>Select an open data platform</h3>
	<p>Before you can publish data, you’ll need somewhere to put it: an <em>open data catalog</em> or <em>open data portal</em>. This is essentially a website where the city can upload and update datasets, and the public can search and download them.</p>
	<p>As with many software choices, your options can be boiled down to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Build your own custom data platform solution</li>
		<li>Buy an off-the-shelf data platform (or rent via an SaaS model)</li>
		<li>borrow from existing open source offerings</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Every city’s requirements are different, but there are two core features integral to any data platform: 1) ability for staff to upload data sets, and 2) ability for visitors to browse, search for, and download data sets.</p>
	<p>In addition, other features are common in many platforms and can be considered high-priority:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Integrated data manipulation (“transformation”) tools</li>
		<li>Integrated visualization tools</li>
		<li>API access for integration and interoperability</li>
		<li>Connections to other relevant open data sources (county, state, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Important criteria to consider when choosing an open data platform include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Feature satisfaction</li>
		<li>Total cost of ownership</li>
		<li>Sustainability of solution by IT (support, maintenance)</li>
		<li>Availability of support options (community, vendors, consultants)</li>
	</ul>	
	<p>There are two main models for open data platforms: software-as-a-service (SAAS) and self-hosted deployment. There are benefits and drawbacks to each. SaaS options include support and hosting from the vendor, which allows government staff to focus on publishing data, not maintaining the application. Self-hosted options allow for flexibility. There are no maintenance contracts or vendors to manage, but staff resources will be required to sustain the portal.</p>
	<h3>Comparing major platform options</h3>
	<h4>Popular open source options</h4>
	<p><strong><a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN (and DKAN)</a></strong></p>
	<p>CKAN -- the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network -- is open source software powering open data platforms across the world.  Provided by the Open Knowledge Foundation in the UK, CKAN is used at the local, regional, national, and international levels of government as well as in academia.  The CKAN application is written in the Python programming language. DKAN is a Drupal-based implementation of CKAN that offers an easier installation and support burden while preserving API compatibility.</p>
	<p>CKAN is used for over two dozen official government data portals around the world. Data.gov, the United States Federal Government’s open data catalog, chose CKAN to power its platform.
There are pre-deployed instances of CKAN that are available to use free of charge to governments and other data producers at <a href="http://www.civicdata.com/en/home">CivicData.com</a> (powered by Accela) and <a href="http://datahub.io/">DataHub.io</a>.</p>
