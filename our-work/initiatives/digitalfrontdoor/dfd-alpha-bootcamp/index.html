		<h3>Digital Front Door Alpha Program - A Web Redesign Bootcamp for Government Communicators. </h3>

	<h3>The Website is your City's Digital Front Door</h3>
	<p>Residents expect to find the same services there they would find inside city hall. Further, we now know that <a href=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/>64% of American adults own a smartphone</a> of some kind and many underserved citizens use a smartphone as their only means of online access. People need and expect to do city business from wherever they are. In this new world, digital first means access for all.</p>
	<h3>Bootcamp Overview</h3>
	<p>The selected five city cohort will prepare for a redesign that makes your website inclusive, service oriented, and mobile ready.</p>
	<p>Learn redesign best practices, by building an alpha website for a department service. An entire website redesign can be a daunting process, often taking years to complete. 
	An Alpha site (a small but public experiment) allows you to reduce risk, try new ideas and get resident feedback early.</p>
	<p>Over 10 weeks, participants will develop skills by prototyping an alpha website that addresses a specific resident need. Finish with a framework and practice ready to apply to a city wide redesign.</p>
