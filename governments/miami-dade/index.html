                        &ldquo;It is a privilege for Miami-Dade County to be Code for Americaâ€™s first government partner in Florida. This collaboration will drive a more open government, stimulate economic development and improve the delivery of regulatory services to our community. Code for America is an organization that has successfully advanced these capabilities through technology and innovation and the organization will be an important partner in our ongoing work to make Miami-Dade County more open, transparent and efficient.&rdquo;

    			<p align="left">During their initial research, the fellows discovered that most residents are not able to successfully acquire a building permit without hiring a building permit consultant. Through process and technological improvements, we hope to design a more intuitive and simple way for residents to obtain a building permit, and find ways to help the County meaningfully collect customer satisfaction feedback. Read more about their process in their midyear report.</p>
