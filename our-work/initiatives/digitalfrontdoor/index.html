			<h2>Goals for the Digital Front Door</h2>
			<p>We put together a list of nine principles for cities that want to launch a Digital Front Door. Every city that launches one agrees to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1. Embrace digital services as central to governing
					<ul>
						<li>Government services should be “digital by default,” available to us on the mainstream platforms and technologies we already use.</li>  
						<li>Services should be useful, accessible, and add value to our lives.</li>
						<li>Government should do more than broadcast out. Tools should make room for interaction, feedback, and citizen participation.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>2. Design with empathy, establish trust
					<ul>
						<li>Government service design should reflect a respect for our time, dignity, and abilities.</li>
						<li>When the act of renewing a driver’s license, filing a request, or getting a business license is pleasant, citizens begin to trust and appreciate government.</li>
						<li>Services should be compelling enough that citizens prefer to use them.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>3. Serve everyone
					<ul>
						<li>Government services should be designed to reach as many citizens as possible regardless of income, location, language, or access to technology.</li>
						<li>Government employees should get out of the building, test assumptions with real citizens, and tweak service design to improve it on a regular basis.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>4. Encourage citizen participation
					<ul>
						<li>Governments and citizens should share in decision-making and service design.</li>
						<li>Services should be built to anticipate participation from employees and citizens in the design and development process.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>5. Be transparent and accountable
					<ul>
						<li>Let citizens and staff see and support what’s going on in government, whether it’s purchasing data, viewing open source code, or accessing open data portals.</li>
						<li>Governments should be clear on the goals of a service and identify areas that can be measured, displayed, and improved on by employees and the public.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div class="layout-minim">
			<ul>
				<li>6. Build for flexibility, welcome change
					<ul>
						<li>Online services are an ongoing investment that require attention and modification over time.</li>
						<li>Government services should be launched as evolving pilot projects rather than one-time massive monoliths.</li>
						<li>Cities should invest in ongoing research, maintenance, and development and should have the internal support to push regular technology upgrades.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>7. Create better processes and policies
					<ul>
						<li>The best government technologies should be easy-to-use and useful in a city employee’s regular work routine.</li>
						<li>Government technology should reduce overall workload and increase the efficiency of city employees.</li>
						<li>City policies should support the creation and deployment of better online services.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>8. Unlock the capabilities of government employees
					<ul>
						<li>Governments should expect city employees to tweak and improve on city services.</li>
						<li>Innovation, technology maintenance, and service design should be a responsibility of all employees, rather than the realm of one group or department.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>9. Get value for tax dollars
					<ul>
						<li>Whether through short-term trials or pilot programs, no system or vendor solution should be deployed en masse without evidence of success.</li>
						<li>When investing in technology, cities should consider their internal skills and ability to maintain and upgrade that technology in the future.</li>
						<li>Governments should reduce barriers to the contracting process and encourage greater competition amongst vendors in order to increase options and drive down the cost of technology.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
