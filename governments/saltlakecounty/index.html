    <h2>The 2016 Fellowship in Salt Lake County</h2>
  </header>
  <!--<p>Code for America is partnering with Salt Lake County to help individuals navigate the court system and decrease costly re-arrests. Nearly 10% of Salt Lake County’s probation clients fail to appear for a required court hearing and 20% fail to appear for the court-ordered treatment that they were placed in to reduce their risk to reoffend.</p> 
  <p>The Salt Lake County project will build on CourtBot, a tool Code for America built for the city of Atlanta, that sends SMS reminders to people who receive traffic citations about their court dates. The population served will be expanded to include criminal defendants and probationers, and will be focused more broadly on helping individuals successfully complete the court process or the terms of their probation.</p>-->
  <p>Code for America and Salt Lake County will work together to safely reduce incarceration in Salt Lake County. For more information on the 2016 Code for America Fellowship see the <a href="http://c4a.me/2016">announcement</a>.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Salt Lake County is struggling with having to re-arrest people for not showing up to a court appearance or to court-ordered treatment. That is expensive, inefficient and—most of all—doesn’t help address the reason behind the original arrest. We’re excited to work with Code for America to find the right technological tool that people can use to avoid being re-arrested. That should help ease overcrowding at the jail and help put individuals on a more constructive path.</p>
