<h1>Code for America Fellowship Toolkit </h1>

<p class="alert">This toolkit documents the Code for America (CfA) Fellowship program within the U.S. with a focus on the strategies we use. We hope that it will serve as a helpful reference to support those in other countries and in the U.S. who are interested in forming their own innovation Fellowships. The following is a living document serving anyone with the desire to replicate or remix parts of our program for their own purposes. This document was originally produced in collaboration by CfA staff: International Programs Manager, Lynn Fine, and Fellowship Program Manager, Alexander Tran. This resource was last updated in January 2015. </p>



<h2>I. WELCOME // BIENVENIDO // CIAO </h2>

<p>If you are looking to start a civic technology innovation program like CfA’s<a href= "http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/">Fellowship </a>program, then you are in the right place.  This toolkit was mainly written to be used by local community groups who want to run “Code for”-style programs, but many of the lessons outlined in this toolkit are also relevant for those of you who work in government and want to bring an innovation Fellowship to your community.</p>

<p><b>This is not your average toolkit.</b> What “works” in the United States won’t necessarily work everywhere, and what works in one context doesn’t necessarily work in another. This toolkit aims to take you on an analytical journey to determine the best way for you to make a difference in your own community using modern principles of design, technology, and social change. This toolkit does not intend to serve as a turnkey solution. In this spirit, we will ask you questions that will help you to evaluate different program options and provide you with a detailed account of how we run our Fellowship program. We will outline our own processes, the reasoning behind them, and provide you with some strategies we’ve found useful. We invite you to mix and match however you see fit and encourage you to<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forms/d/1j09kdqiwi9JRKFwfWX4pUAxmaFyXanRNBCqGU3E78rs/viewform"> share your own experience</a> which we will use to improve this resource.</p>


<h2>II. INTRODUCTION TO CODE FOR AMERICA’S FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM </h2>

<p>To provide some context, here’s the backstory outlining <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2011/09/30/were-two/">how CfA began</a>, eloquently penned in a blog post by the organization’s founder, Jennifer Pahlka. CfA’s Fellowship Program is a year-long public service program in which civic-minded developers, designers, activists, and product managers are grouped into three-person teams. These teams are each paired with a government partner (normally from a city) from different parts of the U.S. Fellows work out of the CfA office in San Francisco to develop solutions to problems facing their  government partners, using technology.

<p>Fellows and the government staff in their partner cities work together to build apps, foster new approaches to problem solving throughout government, and tackle community issues. In the past, teams have worked on improving access to social services, identifying alternatives to incarceration, and civic engagement, among others. You can learn more about past projects <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Fellowship began as CfA's flagship program. Today, it continues to help us learn about the inner workings of government and try out projects that can help governments use digital technology to deliver better services to residents. These learnings inform work in our more scaled programs such as the Brigade and the creation of resources and trainings.</p>

<h2>III. GUIDING QUESTIONS</h2>
<h3>Should you run a Fellowship program (in your country)?<h3>
<p>There are a lot of factors that make it more likely for a CfA-style Fellowship program to succeed. Before running a CfA-inspired Fellowship program, we encourage you to ask yourself the following questions. They should help you decide if it makes sense to run a Fellowship program or if other approaches would be more effective. </p>

<p>Questions to ask yourself:<p>
 
 <ol>
<li>Is there a robust developer community where you live? Enough people with technology skills (ideally young people in their late twenties or so) to make recruiting Fellows possible? If you’re unsure how to determine this it could be helpful to research private sector tech companies or see if there is a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">CfA Brigade</a> CfA’s international citizen volunteer program) group where you live.</li>

<li>Would people from your technology community be interested in dedicating their time for a year of service? If you’re not sure, go to some tech events or ask around at tech companies and other organizations.</li>

<li>Is there a local government office that is particularly interested in working to find technology solutions to service delivery challenges or to foster civic engagement?</li>

<li>Does your government have strict procurement regulations that would make “procuring Fellows” (paying a stipend to Fellows) difficult? You can learn more about procurement <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/procurement/">here</a>.</li>

<p>If yes to above, are there any workarounds to this such as a formal internship or government Fellowship program through which the government could pay for Fellows?</p>

<li>Would your government be willing to pay/have the resources to support this kind of program?</li>

<p>If there are governments that don’t have funds but are interested in the program, are there other possible funding sources? Corporate social responsibility programs? Foundations? See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1Uc8cmQt9-c4DaMD0hvamQwG6cOxNtjFO5Mq6dcdQ9_o/edit#">fundraising resource guide</a> we created for CfA’s Brigades for some ideas. Please note that the Fellowship program generally requires a hefty time commitment from technologists who sign up as Fellows. In our experience, paying Fellows is key to fostering commitment and acquiring a large talent pool for recruiting. </p>

</ol>

<p>If you have answered “NO” to any of the questions outlined above, you might want to consider <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/">other program alternatives</a> before moving forward with a CfA-style Fellowship program. If you have answered yes to these questions, a tailored variation of the CfA Fellowship Program will likely be best instead of trying to do exactly what we do for our Fellowship program. </p>

<p>For example, our Fellowship program works with multiple city governments at the same time throughout the year. Fellows do not live in the cities with which they are paired, but work from CfA’s offices in San Francisco and travel to and from their partner cities about four times a year. This gives Fellowship teams the opportunity to share ideas with other Fellows and draw upon CfA office staff for consistent support and access to mentors who come through our offices. But it also limits collaboration between Fellows and city government partners and has other drawbacks. This model might not make sense in a smaller country or if there aren’t enough resources to cover travel costs for Fellowship teams to frequently visit their government partners. </p>

<p>Some groups have run <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/">Fellowship programs where Fellows lived in their partner cities</a>. This provided lots of opportunities for community organizing and user research. We encourage you to take what works from our model, leave what doesn’t and create the rest (and then share back your learnings with the <a href="http://codeforall.org/">rest of the civic technology community!</a>).  See examples of variations other groups have done <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>V. RECRUITING FELLOWS</h2>

<h3>Strategies for Recruiting Quality Fellows</h3>

<p>Paying fellows sub-market wages makes it difficult to lure candidates away from their high-paying jobs in the tech sector. It is also often hard for candidates to voluntarily uproot their lives and relocate to San Francisco for the Fellowship experience, especially if they have families or community ties. However, we are continually amazed at the quality of the candidates we accept and their ability to innovate in local government. We believe this is in large part thanks to the following recruitment strategies.</p>

<h4>Recruitment Strategies<h4>
<p class="alert" This <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/presentation/d/1YUEvgW9bWCvbaQjrdo-SNVVRUhzsqtyFJwt9pgrxL5s/edit#slide=id.p14">recruitment deck</a> was used at the Harvard Kennedy School to share how the Fellowship program works and some sample projects that fellows work on. </p>

<h5>Messaging</h5>
<p>One question we often get is: how do you frame the Fellowship as a worthwhile opportunity? How do you brand it as cool and worthy of sacrificing the high-paying salaries that potential fellows would get from working in the private tech-sector instead?</p>

<p>Generating buzz and clout around the organization and the program helps to get applicants excited about applying. It’s also really important to reiterate the message that the fellows are joining a community of people who are committed to making a difference. It’s important to appeal to people sense of civic duty by highlighting the opportunity to make a difference and be a part of a bigger network of changemakers. This is especially effective when mentors, staff, and your organization’s larger network lend their credibility to the organization and actively commit to helping fellows continue to do similar work once the Fellowship is over. Highlighting the opportunities for learning during the Fellowship is also a very effective approach.</p>

<p>Getting quality candidates to apply and building the program’s credibility can be very challenging at first. We’ve broken down our strategy into a few key parts: high level press, grassroots communication, and high touch engagements. </p>

<h5>High-level Press</h5>

<p>No matter the size of the population of the community you’re serving, there are bound to be media outlets: TV stations, blogs, radio programs, community gatherings, and listservs that would love to do a story about an event, launch, initiative, or campaign you are creating. Even if the event is only loosely affiliated with the Fellowship program, you can still use this as a chance to promote the program. It’s especially helpful to get someone high profile to pitch the story for you.</p>

<p>We typically develop relationships with both national and local press outlets to pitch stories. We create press releases, share stories with local press and/or local leaders who would be willing to share our message. (See a sample press release from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYHBMkubufM-Y-FSaHNby6WseXfctzuvlzYRz7WH-OA/edit">Code for America’s Fellowship announcement</a>). We also create a list of key, trusted press members who can help get the message out. They especially appreciate it when you give them the “scoop” ahead of time. Don’t be afraid to cold call!</p>

<p>Here are some examples of high level press we’ve generated over the years directed at recruitment. In 2012, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNU1pWSU5HZnB1TjQ/edit">this CNN piece</a> interviewing our founder, Jennifer Pahlka, focused on the genesis of the program. In 2014, we collaborated on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNY1hwZF8tSzdrakU/edit">this smaller piece</a> in FCW News to promote the program to government technology officials who might be eligible to join the Fellowship program. <p>

<h5>Grassroots Communication</h5>

<p>Over the years we’ve built up a sizeable mailing list which we use to spread the word about the Fellowship. Like any social change organization, we grew our list over time. As of June 2014, we have over 14.5k subscribers and use <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">“Mailchimp”</a> for mass mailings. </p>

<p>Here’s an example email we sent to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1-3POEes1u3aLjKC0xflnd_k-HHnNrlWu53GyP_1pemE/edit">followers on our email list</a>. </p>

<p><b>Here are some resources that you could re-purpose for your own efforts:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1ptgrXFnF9wrqMhZqSvnvkUhGPWMbCr5oi4JdzYH-pBk/edit">Fellowship Recruitment Resource One Pager Example.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1--ZHRW4w4F3p1wXqoerDkW-NXtbO0ACabCy3uIrJneM/edit">Fellowship Community Organizer Resources.</a></li>

<p>If you haven’t already built up a network to help you get the word out, the open source technology community in your area can be a great resource, as can partnering with community organizations (such as churches, libraries or non-profits) and enlisting governments in your area to use their media channels to help you get the word out. </p>

<h5>High-Touch Events & Initiatives</h5>

<p>Both of the approaches outlined above have been equally important in getting the word out about our Fellowship. We’ve also used personal recommendations and relationships to drum up interest.These include:</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>

<p>Here are some strategies you can use: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hold events and invite high-profile guests:</b> Host gatherings and events at your offices (or at someone else’s, CfA borrowed many other people’s office spaces before we had our own and often holds events at tech companies’ offices to this day). Most of our mentors are from the government and tech space, and come to our events either as speakers, participants, or in a mentorship capacity. Some of them also serve on our board or on various advisory councils we have. This took CfA years to build up but once we had a couple of high profile people who were very respected in both the tech and gov communities on board it helped us to galvanize interest from others. </li>

<li><b>Leverage your inner network.</b> Advisors and mentors to your organization may take various forms, but if you can leverage them for recruitment, it can really help you create buzz around the program (a tweet, a post or a phone call on behalf of these figures are all great ways to get the word out). This way, you build high profile champions who can back your cause across many platforms and can reach out to their own networks in support of your efforts. </li>

<li><b>Engage your staff.</b> Drawing upon the resources within your own staff can be really effective too, especially at attracting targeted audiences (such as the tech community in your region). Our own CfA tech team did some great work in 2014 telling stories and sharing projects from previous Fellowship classes. In those cases, they went to local tech companies and shared the Fellowship opportunity with that organization and any guests that that organization invited. Many of CfA's international partners have given examples from CfA or other civic organizations that were farther along to paint a picture of what success looks like and of how much fun it could be to get involved. Going to conferences and sharing learnings is also a good way to spread the word. </li>

<li><b>Use regional connections.</b> CfA is lucky to be located in San Francisco and is able to draw from Silicon Valley for candidates. However, we have to leverage regional networks to attract tech talent from all corners of the United States of America. Our top candidates, who typically both have the skills and the passion to make lasting contributions in our space, also typically come from referrals from within our existing network or partner organizations affiliated with our work. This information guides our recruitment process. </li>
</ul>

<p class="alert" <b>Templates for recruitment </b>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1ptgrXFnF9wrqMhZqSvnvkUhGPWMbCr5oi4JdzYH-pBk/edit">Sample Tweets</b></a>: This document contains sample tweets, job descriptions, and an email signature staff can put in their emails to help recruit people. </li>

<li>Facebook Campaign: Use Facebook or a comparable social network to get people interested in the Fellowship. At CfA, we had staff and Fellows post to Facebook/Instagram about “Why They CfA: with an image of them holding up a sign they wrote around our office, and it generated a lot of buzz. </li>

<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/70212611"><b>Code for Mexico City Government Recruitment Video</a></b>: This video was used to get people from Mexico excited about Mexico City Government’s first Fellowship program.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In addition to getting the word out, a big part of Fellowship recruitment is about easing the concern of candidates. The two main concerns we encounter are: 1. I’m scared I won’t be able to find a job post-Fellowship; and 2. I’m worried about relocating. </p>

<p>In response to the first concern we:</p>

<p><b>Offer great networking benefits</b>: CfA provides access to a network of dedicated civic tech professionals and leaders that inspire our work and provide possible career connections for Fellows once the program is complete. We work to connect our Fellows with leaders in civic startups, thought leaders like Tim O’Reilly, government leaders (2013 fellow Laura Meixell now <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNTExPYXFSZmZad1E/edit">works as a data and strategy manager</a> for the government of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and more. </b>

<p>In response to the second concern we:</p>

<p><b>Provide logistical support</b>: CfA allocates staff time to supporting Fellows’ relocation and pre-orientation. We take care of the small stuff like getting them a public transportation card, giving them suggestions for housing and lists of local resources. </p>

<h5>Team Formation </h5>

<p>CfA seeks a diverse Fellowship class at both the team level (Fellows are grouped into teams of three) and within the entire cohort (the entire Fellowship class is approximately 30 Fellows). Each team is treated like a very early stage startup in terms of skill needs. We try to make sure each team has development talent (both backend, frontend, database skills, data science), design talent (user experience, graphic design, design thinking, etc.), and people skills (project management, product management, community engagement, content development, and more.)</p>

<p>Within CfA, we work very hard to foster a culture of collaboration within the cohort because no single team of three is guaranteed to have all the skills they need on their own to develop a finished product. </p>

<p>Some examples of the specific skills we look for can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/presentation/d/1ze5p79dQACvAnsUv5pQakCjIpC8d7oiGWrWWNEp4s-0/edit#slide=id.p16">this deck</a> that we prepared for the Mexico City government when they started a Fellowship program. You can also see a breakdown of data on where our total applicants come from and their skills in <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/08/01/2014_fellows_applications/">this blog post</a>. </p>

<h5>Diversity</h5>

<p>Diversity means something different to everyone, but what we mean by diversity when we talk about it in the context of the CfA Fellowship is that we expect the program to respect people from all walks of life, and that the Fellowship class should reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. </p>

<p>We look for a diversity of skillsets and professional backgrounds that match the needs of our projects. We also actively reach out during our Fellows recruitment process to those who are traditionally less prevalent in the tech sector, such as women, racial minorities, and those of diverse sexual orientations, among others. </p>

<p>We at CfA believe that the richer the diversity of a group, the more perspectives available to draw upon. This is very valuable to the work that we do.</p>

<h2>VI. RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION PROCESS OF GOVERNMENT PARTNERS </h2>

<p>CfA works to promote the Fellowship program and then receives applications from governments that are interested in participating. Once the application cycle is complete, CfA selects which governments to work with based upon pre-established selection criteria. We try to get a lot of different cities throughout the U.S. interested in the program because we work with multiple cities (between 8 and 10) simultaneously. </p>

<p>We mainly work with local governments at the city and county level because we have found that local governments interact the most with everyday people and we want to help these governments to improve their digital services.</p>

<h4>Staff profile: Luke Norris
<p>
<figure>
 <img src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/media/images/people/luke-norris.jpg"> 
    <figcaption>
      Luke Norris, Director of Government Relations at Code for America
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/people/luke-norris/">Luke</a> is CfA’s Director of Government Relations. He’s responsible for developing relationships with governments who might be interested in CfA’s Fellowship Program. He pitches the program and works with them to figure out which specific project would be best. He also helps people understand the value of the Fellowship, how it works, and become comfortable with the changes the Fellowship program will bring. </p>

<p>The Government Relations Director should have a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of government and be comfortable with traditional sales. Knowledge of civic innovation successes is also really important.</p>

<p>For example, before CfA, Luke primarily worked in Business Development roles in technology organizations, focused on developing, prospecting, and negotiating deals and partnerships. </p>

<h4>Laying the Groundwork for Good Government Partners<h4> 

<p>Government officials may not be familiar with the working style of Code for America fellows (agile methodologies, etc). Explaining these and things like “emergent outcomes” are important first steps. Another key component is supporting interested government officials in their own work “selling up or selling down,” helping them approach government officials who may be higher or lower in their city’s hierarchy. The Fellowship team helps government officials do this mainly by giving them experience and coaching them on sharing how the Fellowship can have a positive impact. They provide them with stories, data points, and other information from previous successful projects (such as press clippings, stories about impact). Specifically, they choose a couple of officials within government that can be an internal evangelist of Code for America and the program and give them examples of past CfA projects that are most relevant to their own situation (for example, when CfA was exploring working on education with <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/rhodeisland/">Rhode Island</a>, Luke shared information about CfA’s experience working on similar issues in education with <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/boston/">Boston</a>). These evangelists are critical to making sure that government goes through with the application process. </p>

<p>After developing these internal champions (which is an overall process of 50% salesmanship and 50% coaching), the Fellowship team coaches the cities in getting someone in a senior role into discussions about bringing the Fellowship to that city. This usually begins as a phone conversation with both the internal evangelists and the senior person on their team on the line. From that conversation CfA helps flesh out that team’s motivations and blockers so that we can help them navigate the application process and how to get the project funded. </p>

<h4>Spreading the Word</h4>
<p>We have two main government partner outreach strategies:</p>
<p><b>Broad</p></b>
<p>To get a lot of governments interested in applying for the program, CfA:</p>
<ul>
<li>publicizes the opening of the application process on our website, through our network of government officials (mailing lists, forums, etc.), and on our other networks (see Fellows recruitment section)</li>
<li>leverages strategic connections to help market the Fellowship for us.  We suggest that you look at your funders, your former government partners, your Board, your advisors, etc., and ask them to use their relationships and authority to get government partners interested. </li>
<li>partners with other organizations that help us build credibility. In the US, we work closely with the US Conference of Mayors and the Harvard Kennedy School. We recommend that you build relationships with organizations by offering to be a resource and by positioning your org. as a subject matter expert. These groups will then call on you and engage you in speaking opportunities.</li>
<li>tells stories. We talk about stories that resonate with potential government partners. We get good publicity from success stories from past projects and widely share them.</p></li>
</ul>

<b><p>Targeted </p></b>

<p>The most effective way we’ve found to to get governments interested in participating in the Fellowship program is  to contact them directly. This can be hard if you don’t have a direct connection so you may need to cold call or rely on those in your network to make an intro. Make a pipeline, prioritize and then execute against your outreach plan (calls, emails, etc).

<p>A big part of this strategy for getting governments interested in the Fellowship program revolves around understanding the needs of governments in the U.S. and tailoring our discussion of the Fellowship program to fit their needs. This has the dual effect of increasing the number of government applicants while simultaneously fostering dialogue around the role of technology in improving government at the local level.</p>

<p>Once we have set the stage by publicizing the program among a large audience of potential government partners, we begin a process of even more focused outreach. Think of it as dating between CfA Staff and Government Partners. </p>


<h4>High Level Government Officials<h4>

<p>It is important to partner with mayors and other high-level government officials early on because they can connect and influence other government departments who might be interested in collaborating with the Fellows. Mayors in the U.S. generally understand what’s happening at the ground level in their governments and have the political capital to get others signed on. </p>

<p>It is ideal to approach mayors shortly after an election. In our experience, mayors get excited about the program because they want innovation in their governments, and to be known as trying to “do things differently” with a new policy agenda. They oftentimes hope to use that to carry momentum for their term. Creating positive public relations opportunities such as photo-ops and media attention are helpful in working with mayors and other high level government officials. <p/>

<p>Established tech executives in your community can be helpful in facilitating introductions to these officials (just getting your foot in the door to pitch to an official at that level can be hard). In CfA’s earlier years, we relied heavily on our Board member’s networks. Today, government officials who have participated in the program are extremely useful in getting others on board. On a case-by-case basis, CfA can help to facilitate introductions between mayors in other countries and those in the U.S. who can attest to the value of participating in the Fellowship program.  </p>

<p>Here are some general tips for pitching the Fellowship program to high level government officials:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify their biggest challenges to governing and suggest different ways that technology could help solve them.
Highlight potential for positive publicity from participating in the program.</li>
<li>Articulate the program as a way to help them achieve high-level goals and objectives. Find a specific official who’s responsible for a certain goal and explain how the Fellowship could help them meet that goal.</li>
<li>Frame the Fellowship as a way inspire a culture of innovation that can sweep through their local government.</li>
<li>Emphasize opportunities to increase efficiency, lower costs, enhance civic engagement and foster innovation.</li>
<li>Share examples of success stories, either from your own work or from similar initiatives. You can find a list of examples of "wins" from CfA programs <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah1olKDkcI9WdE1MVHl5ZGQ5LS1TZzRiQjU3Q2ZfX0E&usp=drive_web#gid=1">here</a> and videos showcasing apps and stories from past CfA projects <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/">here.</a></li>
<li>Invite them to a fun event where the energy will get them psyched. Often, asking them to speak is a way to get an official at an event they wouldn’t usually go to.</li>
</ul>

<p>As Luke explains:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“It's about identifying the goals and outcomes for their government. Often I encourage government partners to express problems that citizens encounter. I tell them I want them to do some fact-finding to ensure we know there is an issue and where those issues are. I explain that they can use data to pinpoint areas of opportunities, and then nudge them to identify the goals and outcomes they hope to see through the program.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Government Officials in Middle Management</h4>
<h6>(typically from the government IT Department, like an IT Manager, or from the larger government bureaucracy, like a Policy Manager) </h6>

<p>Middle managers are crucial to government programs. In our experience it’s sometimes hard for them to envision how the Fellowship could be useful for their work. These officials have frequently been charged with safekeeping data and preserving processes which can seem in direct contrast with the Fellowship program. Generally, staff from the government IT department are resource-constrained so they initially see the only value in collaborating with the Fellowship program being an opportunity for their team to contribute to executing something specific and meaningful. The emphasis on cultivating and nurturing “emergent outcomes” that comes out of the Fellowship program is difficult to sell to this constituency. Many times higher level officials have been helpful to us in getting mid-level managers on board.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for pitching the Fellowship program to middle-management government officials (a lot of these strategies are helpful for more senior government officials too):</p>

<ul>
<li>Give them a lot of information and concrete examples from past Fellowship programs. You can find examples of successes in this government <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1YiVsG_l7DXGvwnAq_kPjxnR3HmTvLz_N6wxsigF0SLY/edit">Guide on the Fellowship</a>, which is a handbook we prepare and distribute to government partners (present and potential). </li>

<li>Go over some of the datasets that they already have in-house and explain how those data sets could be made useful. Focus on “non-controversial” datasets first. For example, if they have a dataset that lists all of the times and dates that garbage is picked up, explain how that dataset could be used as an input to an SMS application that can remind residents to take out their trash on that day. If you have the resources, it’s even better to show these “quick-wins” and build something simple that will give officials a clear picture of what can be accomplished. </li>

<li>Focus your efforts on approaching top managers within these departments who have decision-making power.</li>

<li>Try to get to know officials on a personal level and better understand the constraints facing their department, what they’re passionate about and what issues they’d like to work on. Find examples of civic tech innovations that could address those issues or brainstorm ideas for future projects that could be effective at leveraging technology to solve their problem.</li>

<li>Target outreach efforts to Innovation Officers, Chief Data Officers, and Chief Digital Officers (or their equivalent) if these positions exist in the government you’re interested in working with. People with these roles can be very effective allies.</li>

<li>Build a relationship with local citizen engagement and civic technology groups (if they exist), like a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Brigade</a> in your community. They can connect you with officials.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you approach people in government about the Fellowship program, it’s important to be mindful of the language you use. If you have a technology background, don’t make any assumptions about a government official’s degree of technical expertise. Avoid using terms such as “open source, GitHub issues, API, prototyping, agile development” and other “jargon” unless you take the time to explain the meaning. These terms are commonplace in the technology world but are mostly foreign to government workers. Using tech-heavy terminology can be isolating, patronizing and, most importantly, derail the potential for collaboration.  </p>

<p>Framing is also key. In CfA’s early days we made the mistake of presenting the program as CfA Fellows “fixing government.” The Fellowship program should always be presented as a partnership between two groups that are passionate about public service and want to make a difference in their communities. The emphasis on collaboration and participatory processes should be established at the very beginning.  Resources from our Brigade toolkit on <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1WtoE_Kfqcu73MCUOIXujrzTfqrQAW3DGt0sC8iKJ6Rw/edit#heading=h.z53m2pux0tw5">how to collaborate with government</a> may also be useful to you in your efforts to pitch the program to potential government partners.  </p>

<h4>Approaching Potential Partners</h4>
<p>The road to contracting with government partners differs a lot with each potential partner. When CfA first started out, we used personal networks, our Board, and publicity from speaking at events like government conferences to drum up interest in our programs. Now that we have a reputation for the work we’ve done, things play out a bit differently. Here are some examples to give you an idea of how we form partnerships with government partners.</p>

<ul>
<li>Somerville approached us to get involved in Code for America’s <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/">Digital Front Door</a> project. Code for America couldn’t work with them on that project, but we identified that Somerville officials wanted access to new tech and new ways of doing things. Our Fellowship team helped them understand how the Fellowship could support them in accomplishing their goals. They’re currently one of our <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/2015-cities/">2015 Fellowship cities</a>.</li>
<li>In Indianapolis, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana (a previous Code for America partner) sent a letter to the mayor of Indianapolis recommending that the city work with Code for America. This opened up a conversation with the mayor of Indianapolis about how partnering with CfA could help make progress towards goals they had for improving public safety in the city. This is an example of how government officials you’ve worked with in the past can be important advocates by introducing you to people in their network and by speaking on your behalf.</li>
<li>In Richmond, VA’s case, the government officials there had applied previously for CfA’s Fellowship program but weren’t selected because there wasn’t a clear and specifically scoped out problem that the Fellowship program could help to solve. The Fellowship team kept Richmond engaged with Code for America through the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/peernetwork/">Peer Network</a> (our network of government officials who receive trainings through webinars and connect to each other about how to use technology to better solve civic issues). They also kept in touch with government contacts in Richmond, educating them about our model, and working to better understand their thinking about the impact they want to make using technology. It was a long process of building the relationship and scoping out a possible project. We were eventually able to figure out a place where their needs overlapped with what the Fellowship program could offer and Richmond is a 2015 Fellowship city.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Application Flow</h4>

<p>Code for America aims to both have the best applications, and as many as possible. We encourage many cities to apply even if funding is unclear, as we can help them figure that out later on in the process. Also, many first time applicants become cities in future rounds if they don’t make it the first time. In terms of communications, between Jan and March 31s we expect to have approximately 7-12 communications with the cities who are going through the application process, 3-4 times a month.</p>

<h4>Selection Criteria</h4>

<p>We use the following criteria to determine which cities applying to the Fellowship program we should work with:</p>
<ul>
<li>strong leadership and buy-in for the program</li>
<li>internal sponsorship by key players in and outside of the department Code for America fellows would partner with
a potential for impact and general project scope that aligns with Code for America’s <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/">focus areas</a></li>
<li>confirmed or promised budget (these normally include prospective matching funds) </li>
<li>a clear understanding of CfA’s approach</li>
demonstrated interest in improving digital services in tangible ways (evidence we can actually see)
