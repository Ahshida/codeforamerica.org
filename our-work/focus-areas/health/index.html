		<div class="layout-minim">
			<!-- inline style to keep text and video top-aligned -->
			<p style="margin-top:0">The health focus area works to improve  the health of people and the communities they live in. Health depends on many factors: from the environment people live in, to how easy it is to sign up for, use, and deliver digital services.</p>
			<p>We work with the wide variety of teams that contribute to this outcome—including city health departments, public health agencies, state offices, and non-profit organizations. Together, we develop digital services to meaningfully improve health outcomes. In the process, we help these teams retool their ways of delivering services to operate more effectively in the digital world.</p>

		<h3 class="heading">Get Involved</h3>
		<p>Pursuing better health in a community often requires partnerships that span the public, non-profit, and private sectors. In San Francisco for example, our work to improve food security is built on foundational partnerships with the San Francisco Human Services Agency, the Food Bank of San Francisco and Marin, and a coalition of community partners. This public interest work is often supported by generous support from corporate and institutional funders.</p>

		<p>To expand our work and deepen our impact, we’re seeking partners in cities and states across the country, along with key institutional support. If you are committed to improve health in your community through the transformation of public services, <a href="mailto:rebeccac@codeforamerica.org">contact us.</a></p>

		<h3>How we work</h3>
		<p>Code for America’s focus areas support and bring together work across all of our programs to deliver an impact greater than what an individual program might achieve on its own. Across our programs, we undertake deep research into the delivery of critical services, develop new digital approaches to health, incubate digital products as they mature, and work with the highest level of government support to scale digital services. Throughout these efforts, we work to empower our partner organizations through the <a href="/governments/principles">Principles of 21st Century Government.</a></p>

		<h4>Partnering with governments to produce original digital services</h4>
		<h5>Health Fellowships</h5>
		<p>The Code for America Fellowship Program recruits teams of technologists for a year of deep partnership with a local government and the community  around a new or improved digital service. The output includes an “alpha” product for that digital service, an understanding of the problem space in one community informed by our Peer Network, a local government partner with greater capacity to demonstrate the Principles for 21st Century Government, and strong relationships across the service delivery team that can be leveraged in the future.</p>

		<div class="layout-minim">
			<p>Beyond the fellowship, our staff technologists, designers, and researchers experiment and invest over time in high potential digital services.</p>
			<p>In 2015, we are conducting ongoing research and product development to both improve the experience and enrollment rate of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) rate in California, building off foundational work done by the San Francisco Fellowship team in 2013.</p>
