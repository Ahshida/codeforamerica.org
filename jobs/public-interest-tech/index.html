    <h2>Director, Public Interest Technology Baseline Project</h2>
  </header>

  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>With support from the Ford Foundation, <a href="http://netgainpartnership.org/" target="_blank">Netgain</a> and organizations in the civic and public interest technology space are launching a project to better understand how to support and grow the field of public interest technologists -- including barriers to entry for technologists into careers in public interest tech, along with challenges to sustaining careers and leadership roles.</p>
  <p>With the launch of federal entities like the U.S. Digital Service and 18F, the proliferation of technologist roles within local and state level governments, the growing urgency for technologists who are working to protect the open internet, and the proliferation of startups tackling public services, there are unprecedented opportunities for those with technical skills and entrepreneurial talent to contribute time to public service rather than the private tech industry.</p>
  <p>However, there is little empirical knowledge about who is currently in the field of public interest technology, or community based input about the experiences of technologists in public service roles, including what motivated them to explore this career path, what kind of training or experience they require to be successful in public interest tech, and the challenges to sustaining careers.</p>
  <p>We are seeking a project director and team who can help us better understand the current public interest technology ecosystem, the individuals currently working within it, their career paths until this point and insights on how to best invest in and support leaders in the field, as well as those wishing to enter.</p>

  <p><strong>The project director and team will:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oversee all aspects of the project including overall project design, development and execution for 8 months on a part-time basis.</li>
    <li>Hire and manage a research team to design and implement the survey instrument and data-gathering process.</li>
    <li>Identify and manage project partners (a group of 5-6 organizations who will advise and help amplify the project)</li>
    <li>Identify and manage “fellows” (10-12 people who are leaders in their respective community and responsible for gathering survey and community feedback)</li>
    <li>Create and publish a final report with findings of the survey and commitments from anchor partners based on those findings</li>
    <li>Recommend at least two pilot projects based on research</li>
    <li>Draft grant reports to be delivered to the community, partners and funders</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Requirements include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Robust experience in the public interest technology, social impact, or public sector fields.</li>
    <li>Track record of creating productive collaborations among diverse groups of people and organizations.</li>
    <li>Demonstrable experience managing cross-functional projects and people.</li>
    <li>Exceptional communication skills, both written and verbal, including experience presenting to large audiences.</li>
    <li>Strong research and analytical skills.</li>
    <li>Significant management experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>We are open to either a consulting firm or an independent contractor to complete this project.</strong></p>
  <p>Code for America is acting as the fiscal sponsor for this project and will be administering payments, but the program manager will be accountable for deliverables to the advisory group formed by the anchor partners. This is a one-year contractor position, and visa sponsorship is unfortunately not available for this role. Candidates can be located anywhere in the US.</p>
