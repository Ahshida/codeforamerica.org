    "content":"<p>During week two of our 2015 Code for America Fellowship, the fellows and I jumped feet first into <a title=\"Build Week: Kicking off a Year of Building, Testing, and Making Change\" href=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/blog\/2015\/01\/14\/build-week-kicking-off-a-year-of-building-testing-and-making-change\/\">\u201cBuild Week.\u201d<\/a> The goal? Work together with our teams and build something &#8212; anything &#8212; together.<\/p>\n<p>My team, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/governments\/vallejo\/\" target=\"_blank\">Team Vallejo<\/a>, sought to learn more about our city\u2019s focus area, safety and justice, and pick a small thing to build as a hypothesis for the rest of the year.<\/p>\n<p>During our research, we found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timesheraldonline.com\/general-news\/20150110\/vallejo-neighborhood-takes-stand-against-crime\" target=\"_blank\">an inspiring account of communities in Vallejo bonding together<\/a> and taking proactive measures towards their safety and well being; a story that illustrated for me the importance of building and acting towards something you believe in.<\/p>\n<p>Over a four year span, the Vallejo police force dramatically decreased from almost 160 officers in 2008 to just over 80 officers in 2012. With only one officer to care for 1,300 residents, they had to prioritize their efforts to violent crimes and 911 calls.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-24-at-6.59.58-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-32654\" src=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-24-at-6.59.58-PM.png\" alt=\"Vallejo Police Department bar graph 2008 compared to 2012\" width=\"304\" height=\"229\" \/><\/a>Despite the discouraging drop in the police force, Neighborhood Watch communities surprisingly rose from under 30 groups in 2009 to almost 300 groups in 2013. During Build Week, my team and I were honored to speak with Tina E., one of the pioneers of Vallejo\u2019s earliest Neighborhood Watch communities during this crucial time, about how she evangelized Neighborhood Watch groups around the city by taking action into her own hands.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone was fed up. One neighborhood was suffering from as many as 3 burglaries in one week within a one block radius.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople were tired of hearing about how Vallejo is dangerous, and they knew the PD didn\u2019t have enough people,\u201d Tina recounted.<\/p>\n<p>So Tina, fed up with worrying about her safety and with a newborn on the way, decided to map the crimes in her neighborhood and post them on every neighbor\u2019s door to raise awareness of the seriousness of the issue and the need for everyone to work together to do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce they started seeing the reports, and I started talking to them in person, people wanted to get involved,\u201d Tina said.<\/p>\n<p>Tina arranged meetings on her front lawn and taught visibility drills to neighbors so that when a criminal was in their midst, they would all bond together and take action to make their presence as a bonded community known. Once, her community worked together and actually caught and held a burglar until the police arrived.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-32653\" src=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-24-at-6.59.39-PM.png\" alt=\"Neighborhood watch groups bar graph 2009 compared to 2013\" width=\"301\" height=\"211\" \/>Within only 18 months, Tina\u2019s community watch group rose from only 6 people to more than 120, and that was just on her block. By 2013, there were more than 300 neighborhood watch communities active around Vallejo.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chain reaction, it spreads like wildfire because everyone becomes a community of friends and you want to help,\u201d Tina recounted as my teammates and I sat in awe. I realized this was a perfect example of a phrase often heard at Code for America: government for the people, by the people.<\/p>\n<p>This group isn\u2019t just a group of Neighborhood Watchers, anonymously watching and reporting crimes to the police, they are a group of Neighborhood Doers. They proactively work together to prevent crime from happening by acting and organizing together. They have created transparency and awareness about problems that need to be addressed, have organized to address that problem, and have taken creative approaches to build a safer, more connected neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>Build week was not just a week to make an app and see how we work with our teams (though we did build an app that we\u2019ll be testing soon). It was our team\u2019s chance to see that we too can make things work if we jump in and take action, if we <em>do<\/em>\u00a0something and lead by example. Not just talk about it, not just complain about it, not just rant about how we do or do not like this or that, not just watch and report about it, but <em>do it<\/em>. Organize together, use all of the capable and intelligent humans around you and take action together to make the world how we know we deserve it to be. Get up and build a future that you can feel proud of. Create for ourselves a government <em>by<\/em>\u00a0the people, for the people, that\u2019s what this week was about.<\/p>\n<p>In that brief week, I witnessed Code for America as a <em>doing<\/em>\u00a0organization. Tina and her neighborhood group are a <em>doing\u00a0<\/em>community. And now my teammates, city partners, and fellow fellows are <em>doing<\/em>\u00a0teams &#8212; making things work for us and others, and realizing that the best way to get things done and create positive change isn\u2019t by waiting and wondering, it\u2019s by understanding the community needs, rallying a group of committed and passionate individuals towards a common goal, and iterating until it works.<\/p>\n",

Photo by Molly McLeod.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The Code for America office is buzzing with people and energy this week. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/geeks\/our-geeks\/2015-fellows\/\">2015 Fellows<\/a> have arrived for a month of training and preparation before heading out to immerse themselves in their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/governments\/2015-cities\/\">host governments<\/a> in February. This is the 5th year of the Fellowship, and every year we refine the orientation program to better fit the needs of incoming fellows and partners.<\/p>\n<p>So this week, the week of January 12th, the calendar is nearly blank and\u00a0we\u2019re really excited about that. Welcome to the first ever January Build Week!<\/p>\n<h3>What We Learned<\/h3>\n<p>January training has historically included a couple of days where the fellows build a small project, but every class said that wasn\u2019t enough. It turns out that all the care and time we put into hiring people with a strong bias toward action results in, well, fellows with a strong bias toward action, who learn best by doing. Structuring most of their orientation month around lectures and sit-down workshops sent them to their intensive February residency already tired.<\/p>\n<p>Like every class, the 2015 fellowship class includes individuals with strong skill-sets, from GIS to user-centered design to database engineering. They don\u2019t need to learn those skills, but they do need to get used to the specific tools we use here, and to working with government data. Not to mention two brand-new teammates, strangers until a week ago, to establish solid working relationships with for the year.<\/p>\n<h3>Now, Make a Thing<\/h3>\n<p>Next week, we\u2019ll return to offering clinics on research strategies and the structure of local government. But this week, <strong>every team has one goal: build something small and useful related to the issue area you&#8217;ll be working on in your city.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>City partners are being introduced to their teams, sending over datasets, and setting up interviews for fellows.. Teams are holding stand-ups, figuring out how to make quick prototypes and test them, and starting to commit code. On Friday, the fellows will give their first informal presentation in the supportive environment of CfA HQ, preparation for all of the public talks and demos they will give this year.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_32600\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/FellowsBuildWeek.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-32600\" src=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/FellowsBuildWeek.jpg\" alt=\"Fellows Build Week\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Team Albuquerque starts building. Photo by Molly McLeod.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>It feels great to be doing instead of waiting.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Like anything that becomes clear after several rounds of iteration, it feels like we should have known to do this all along. That\u2019s the nature of a user-centered process when the goal isn\u2019t fully understood. We always knew the goal was \u201cprepare the fellows for the fellowship year,\u201d but we needed feedback from early partners and fellows to understand everything that that implied.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re asking more of this new class of fellows than of any class yet, and we hope we\u2019re giving them and their partners the most useful support we\u2019ve ever offered. We\u2019re looking forward to what comes out of Build Week, as the very first iteration in a long, inspiring year full of building, testing, and making change together.<\/p>\n",

Congratulations! You\u2019re gonna have a great year.<\/p>\n<p>As the 2014 class wrapped up our Fellowship, we reflected on things we didn\u2019t realize at first, things we wish we had thought about more (or sooner), and things we learned along the way.<\/p>\n<p>While you still have time before the Fellowship starts, I want to share with you some of our takeaways. It\u2019s gonna get crazy and it\u2019s gonna be great!<\/p>\n<p><b>1. Don\u2019t worry<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Please don\u2019t waste energy feeling like an impostor. Some of you may be intimidated by the bios of your fellow fellows. I sure was. Don\u2019t worry. You are here for many reasons and you will have many opportunities to demonstrate your unique skill set.<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Keep in mind what comes after the Fellowship<\/b><\/p>\n<p>This is harder than it sounds. This year can lead you in so many places. You\u2019ll have the chance to learn many skills and gain incredible experience in this hybrid gov\/tech sphere. And while your primary focus is your Fellowship city project, keep in mind what you want to do after, and strive to focus your energies to support that.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is it\u2019s a one-year program. You\u2019ll do something else next year, whether that\u2019s in civic tech or not. The people that you will work with this year will totally understand that you\u2019ll go on to do something else great.<\/p>\n<p><b>3. You will be super different from your teammates.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The team relationship is challenging. Here\u2019s why: you\u2019re all different! You\u2019re dropped into a close working environment with two strangers and you spend the year working very closely together on an intense project. Friction occurs.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some things you should talk about with your teammates to understand where they are coming from:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>How you think about the Fellowship<\/i><\/b>. Like a start-up? Like an exploratory experimental fellowship year? Like a regular 9-5?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>How you work best<\/i><\/b>. Do you need deadlines? Do you need your space? Do you prefer a weekly check-in or a daily touch-base?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>How you personally make decisions<\/i><\/b>. Do you decide things immediately? Do you make a list of pros and cons? Do you desire a spirited debate? Or do you like to have time to think about it before deciding?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>What are your work hours<\/i><\/b>. Some people work best from noon to 8pm. Some are 10-6ers. Some are early risers. Everyone works differently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>Preferred methods of communication<\/i><\/b>. Email? Text? Trello board? Slack? In-person meetings?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Everyone is coming from a different place with a different history. Like all new relationships, there\u2019s a ton to learn and negotiate and compromise on. Remember that your way of doing things is no more or less right than your teammates\u2019. Be honest about the way you are and be ready to accept your teammates as they are.<\/p>\n<p><b>4. Invest a lot of time and love in the other Fellows.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the greatest asset of this Fellowship. You will do great work that you will be immensely proud of. But there is no other year of your life where you\u2019ll be around 23 other talented, quirky, big-hearted people with the same crazy hard job as you. You\u2019ll start travelling and going all different ways, so <i>hang out <\/i>with each other when you can.<\/p>\n<p><b>5. Take care of yourself<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Fellowship year is an endurance race, not a sprint. It\u2019ll never seem like the right time to take a vacation, but it\u2019s important to take time off and keep yourself 100%. Make doctor\u2019s appointments; stay on top of your personal life. Have other friends. Stay healthy and try to maintain the habits that keep you that way.<\/p>\n<p>Have a great year. I can say without reserve that the work I did with Code for America is the work I am most proud of in my life so far. It was done with top-quality teammates, for a mission I believe in, to address <i>real problems<\/i> in people\u2019s lives and to improve real processes in the government. It was intense and it was the best.<\/p>\n<p>Always feel free to reach out to any of the alumni fellows. We\u2019ve been where you are and we are <i>happy<\/i> to talk about this amazing shared experience<i>.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Best,<\/p>\n<p>Ainsley Wagoner<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/governments\/sanjuan\/\">2014 Fellow, Team Puerto Rico<\/a><\/p>\n",
