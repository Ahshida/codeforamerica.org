            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>GIS is extremely powerful, but the language of maps can be confusing. Join us to discuss how we can effectively communicate within City Hall to build enthusiasm for mapping. We will explore some of the latest techniques for web mapping and spatial analysis. The sheer number of tools beyond ArcGISDesktop can be intimidating. Where do you start? By learning the vocabulary and the landscape of geospatial technology, we can start to pick the best tools for the work we're seeking to accomplish and adequately assess which particular one is best for any given job.</p>
