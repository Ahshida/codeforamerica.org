This guide explains the metrics you need to measure to work out how your city website is performing. You'll need to monitor them to make sure your website is efficient and providing value for money. By regularly examining them, you'll be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your city website and find ways to improve it.

## Website key performance indicators

### Cost per transaction

Cost per transaction is about how much it costs your government to provide each completed transaction.

### User satisfaction

User satisfaction helps you to measure the overall quality of your city's website.

### Completion rate

When users are unable to complete a digital transaction, they can be pushed to use other channels. This leads to low levels of digital take-up and customer satisfaction, and a higher cost per transaction.

Measuring end-to-end completion rates helps to identify whether users have problems completing a transaction. Examing the drop-out rate at each step of a transaction will pinpoint the specific processes that users fail to complete.

### Digital take-up

Digital take-up is a long term strategic measure of how well a change to a digital by default strategy is working. 

### Service availability

 - Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time
 - Monitor system performance in real-time (e.g. response time, latency, throughput, and error rates)
 
## Set a baseline

Establish a ‘baseline’ based on the current performance trends of each channel. 


Use this to judge the effectiveness of any changes to your service. This will help you pinpoint the effectiveness of your initiatives, and identify what worked.

Look at performance trends over time, rather than taking a snapshot at a particular point. Peaks and dips in performance can then be measured in relation to this base (or trend) line, which helps to:

 - identify the effect of your communications or design initiatives
 - reveal seasonal variations in performance

don't do a healthcare.gov



## What "good" performance looks like

 - Ensure monitoring can measure median, 95th percentile, and 98th percentile performance
 - something about availability like twitter, facebook, because fail whale isn't funny
