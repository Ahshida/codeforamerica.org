                        <p>Pittsburgh is a post-rust belt success story, with a booming new economy centered around its universities, hospitals and philanthropic institutions. The city is poised to take the next step with a new administration dedicated to reinventing one of the least sexy but most central functions of government: procurement. Pittsburgh will work with a CfA fellowship team to use technology and user centered design to fundamentally change the outmoded and inefficient way it buys everything from software to paperclips.</p>

We look forward to working in particular on new approaches to procurement that drive increased community participation, and in so doing, build the digital capabilities of our great city. I know the Fellows can learn from us -- and us from them -- as we work together to make government better for city residents.&rdquo;

    			<h2>The 2015 Fellowship in Pittsburgh</h2></header>
    				<p>The ways in which governments buy what they need is a fundamental part of how they function. Improving procurement requires addressing the basics, which carries implications for the ways governments provide quality service to their citizens. In February, the Pittsburgh fellowship team conducted user interviews with over 50 City employees as well as 25 local businesses. These conversations highlighted frustrations shared across the board.</p>
    				<p>Some of those frustrations include:</p> 
    					<li>Businesses interested in working with the city cannot easily access information about work opportunities.</li>
					<li>Keeping track of all the different procurement procedures is anxiety-inducing for city staff.</li>
					<li>Lack of well-documented, easy to find instructions often leads to wasted effort on the wrong process and extended back-and-forth.</li>
					<li>It is hard for city staff to find information about existing contracts.</li>
					<li>The contract renewal process is lengthy, difficult, and non-transparent.</li>
				<p>Tasked with making procedural and technological inroads with procurement in Pittsburgh, the Code for America fellows identified three distinct but related problem areas and are currently building out tools to help address them:</p>
					<li><strong>The Marketplace</strong> - The fellows believe they can provide great value to city staff and the local business community by increasing the number of businesses who know about and respond to city opportunities. They have a working prototype called <a href="http://pittsburgh-purchasing.herokuapp.com/opportunities/">Beacon</a>which creats more transparency into the RFP process.</li>
					<li><strong>The Playbook</strong></li>
					<li><strong>The Inventory</strong></li>
