    <h2>The 2016 Fellowship in Salt Lake County</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Code for America is partnering with Salt Lake County to help individuals show up for their required court hearings and avoid re-arrest. Nearly 10 percent of the county’s probation clients fail to appear in court. About 20 percent don’t show up for the court-ordered treatment which is intended to lower their risk of reoffense.</p>
  <p>The Salt Lake County project will build on <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/focus/safety-justice/courtbot/">CourtBot</a>, a tool Code for America built for the city of Atlanta that sends SMS reminders to people who receive traffic citations about their court dates. The population served will be expanded to include criminal defendants and probationers. A broader focus will aim to increase the number of individuals who successfully complete the court process and fulfill the terms of their probation.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Salt Lake County is struggling with having to re-arrest people for not showing up to a court appearance or to court-ordered treatment. That is expensive, inefficient and—most of all—doesn’t help address the reason behind the original arrest. We’re excited to work with Code for America to find the right technological tool that people can use to avoid being re-arrested. That should help ease overcrowding at the jail and help put individuals on a more constructive path.</p>
