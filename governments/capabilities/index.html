                <h2>New Digital Principles for 21st Century Governments</h2>
            </header>
            
           <p>  Through Fellowships with 32 local governments since 2011, we’ve identified seven principles that help governments be more effective, efficient, and fair in the 21st century. Code for America helps local governments learn and apply these principles to important problems. </p>

<p>We believe these new principles are critical for governments of any size, structure, or political persuasion in serving their communities. </p>

           	<p>Government’s purpose is to serve residents, and we can do this best when we deeply understand who we’re working for. A 21st Century Government:</p>
           	<ul>
           		<li>Begins any project by conducting research with real people to understand who they are, what they need, and how they behave.</li>

		<p>Serving everyone means working with, not just for, a true cross-section of the community. A 21st Century Government:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Proactively creates ways for every community member to take part in decisions and issues that affect them, regardless of language or ability.</li>

			<li><strong>South Bend, Ind.: CityVoice.</strong> In South Bend, the city deployed CityVoice to let residents call in and tell the city what they thought should be done with vacant and abandoned properties in their neighborhood, and listen to what their neighbors said about the same properties.

             	<h3>Collaborate with others</h3>
	</header>
		<p>Residents, community groups, local institutions, and other governing bodies have a lot of knowledge, skills, and experiences to share with government. Governments can proactively collaborate with other institutions and organizations to draw on those resources and strengthen a local ecosystem of civic innovation. In this role, government can also serve as a platform and enabler for other groups invested in improving the community.</p>
           	
           	<h4>How other cities have done it</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Chicago: Flu Shot App</strong> The City of Chicago has collaborated closely with the Smart Chicago Collaborative to expand the city’s open data initiative and spur technologists to build atop the city’s data. When the City needed a tool to help residents find locations for free flu shots, members of the Smart Chicago Collaborative built an app using city data.</li>
			<li><strong>Oakland: Write-a-Thon</strong>In Oakland, the city co-hosted a write-a-thon with a local community group.   Together, citizen and city officials wrote answers to the most frequent search queries on the city website to make sure citizens could find what they were looking for.</li>

             	<h3>Default to open</h3>
	</header>
		<p>When public data is made freely available in open, standardized formats, it can drive transparency, community engagement, and accountability. Governments around the country are building a culture and commitment to openness in City Hall across departments by making government data openly and easily available to citizens — and supporting open data with process and technology.</p>
           	
           	<h4>How other cities have done it</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>San Francisco: Open Data Policy</strong> San Francisco is one of thirty-three cities and counties around the country that have passed an Open Data policy to make open, standardized data the default. San Franciso's policy establishes designated open data coordinators for each department as well as a Chief Data Officer to oversee the effort.</li>
			<li><strong>Albuquerque: Reducing 311 Calls</strong> Opening data can reduce the number of phone calls for citizens to obtain information. People calling about Transit issues in Albuquerque were usually waiting for a bus and wanting to know where it was right then. Based on this analysis, the City decided to open up their transit data. Making these datasets available saved about $180,000 in 2013 in calls to the 311 call center alone.</li>
			<li><strong>Louisville: Restaurant Inspection Information on Yelp</strong> Louisville published restaurant inspection data in an open, standardized format set by a cohort of other cities, third party organizations, and industry. Yelp was then able to consume the data easily and publish it alongside its popular online restaurant reviews, making the data more useful and accessible to the average citizen.</li>

             	<h3>Leverage data for better decisions</h3>
	</header>
		<p>Government can use data to inform better decisions, analyzing and learning from real-world results to continuously drive insights into and improvement of government processes and services. Embracing approaches like analytics, data-informed performance management techniques, and predictive modeling can help government drive insights into resident behavior and expectations, effective approaches, and opportunities to improve efficiency. </p>
           	
           	<h4>How other cities have done it</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Louisville: LouieStat</strong> Louisville created the LouieStat performance improvement program to help departments use data to better understand and continuously improve their workflows. Using data-informed approaches, they were able to reduce unscheduled overtime and workers’ compensation expenditures by more than $2 million. </li>
			<li><strong>New York City: Mayor's Office of Data Analytics</strong> New York City created a data analytics team within the Mayor's Office. They applied data analytics to address a major public safety risk: illegal building conversions. The team opened and integrated data that had previously been siloed within by several departments and analyzed it to increase accurate inspection targeting and better allocate scarce resources where they will do the most good.</li>

             	<h3>Create greater choice of tools</h3>
	</header>
		<p>Legacy procurement regulations and policies favors the legacy companies that have expertise in navigating procurement, but not necessarily the best company for the job. Government can rethink the way it approaches procurement — both policy and process — to create greater flexibility to choose the best solutions and services for our modern society, while protecting the principles of fair competition and clear accountability.</p>

	<header class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-red">
             	<h3>Organize for outcomes</h3>
	</header>
		<p>By creating an upfront commitment to innovation by dedicating internal resources to it, government can empower public employees to try new approaches and foster sustainable impact. Oftentimes, this commitment comes from the executive level. It doesn't necessarily require large financial investment — government can act in an entrepreneurial way to get things going. This can include creating job titles and organizational focus (creating an innovation team) to prioritize leveraging data and technology to make good decisions, and investing in building the staff skillsets and competencies (through new hires and professional development of existing staff) at all levels of the organization.</p>
           	
           	<h4>How other cities have done it</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>San Francisco Innovation Fellowship:</strong> The City of San Francisco created the Mayor’s Innovation Fellowship to bring young professionals with new skillsets and perspectives to work in public service for a year-long fellowship program.</li>
			<li><strong>Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics:</strong> Boston’s, Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics acts as a "risk aggregator" within City Hall, tasked with taking new approaches to solving civic problems. The Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics operates autonomously in the sense that they choose what they work, but they balance this with staying in alignment with the Mayor’s executive vision for the City.
</li>
	<li><strong>Denver Peak Academy:</strong> In Denver, department heads learn lean problem-solving techniques through the Peak Academy program. After four hours of Peak Academy training, one Denver colleague went back to her wastewater division office where she has worked for years and promptly created over $46,000 of annual savings.</li>
