		<h3>Our Mission</h3>
		<div class="layout-minim">
			<p>Code for America’s Focus Areas are where we demonstrate the human impact of 21st Century Government and improved digital services. In 2014, we launched our first three Focus Areas in Health, Economic Development, and Safety and Justice. </p>

			<p>Within the Health Focus Area, we use the term health as a community outcome that is deeply affected by a communities lived environment, and the enrollment, usability, and delivery of digital services, especially for the safety net. We take an expansive view of the local agencies and services that contribute to this outcome, but typically work with Health Departments, Human Service Agencies, Public Health Agencies, and the organizations that deliver government funded health services such as public hospitals and clinics, and non profits like the Food Bank. </p>

		<h3>Our programs</h3>
		<p>Code for America’s Focus Areas support and integrate our diverse programming so that the  work’s impact is greater than the sum of its parts. Our work consists of three primary thruts of work: the Health Lab, Health Fellowships, and Product Residencies.</p>
		<div class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-blue">
		    <h4>Health Lab</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="layout-minim">
			<p>The Health Focus Area is also experimenting with infrastructure to invest and experiment over time in high potential digital services through the Health Lab. Our initial work in the Health Lab builds on the 2013 Fellowship in San Francisco to improve the enrollment and usability of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). </p>

		<div class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-blue">
		    <h4>Health Fellowships</h4>
		</div>
		<p>The Fellowship Program is an intensive year of deep partnership with one local city or county around a new or improved digital service. The output includes a alpha product for that digital service, an understanding of the problem space in one community informed by our broader Gov Network, a local government partner with greater capacity to demonstrate the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/">Principles for 21st Century Government</a>, and strong relationships across related non-profits and delivery organizations that can be leveraged in the future. </p>
