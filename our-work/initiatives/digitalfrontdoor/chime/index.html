    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
    You may have heard that we were developing a content management system designed for government called ChimeCMS. We&#x2019;ve recently decided to stop development of ChimeCMS.

    <h4>Background: Why Chime?</h4>

    <p>
    Since founding Code for America (CfA) in 2011, we've heard about the pain points Cities face in keeping their primary website experience current for residents who need and expect to complete City business online. Last year we kicked off the Digital Front Door initiative, an R&#x26;D project the CfA technology team has been piloting to assess &#x26; improve how cities communicate and serve residents via their primary website.
    </p>

    <p>
    The most significant conclusion from the Digital Front Door Initiative was that a simple, modern CMS designed for the work of government is the best way to make City websites work for resident needs, including the traditionally underserved. Nine months ago, we reviewed the available content management systems for government websites and found none that met delivered on our Design Principles or Practices. This led to our strategy of developing a content management system designed for government called ChimeCMS. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Our recent research and work with our 5 bootcamp cities confirmed that there&#x2019;s a large need for a CMS that meets the needs of local governments, as well as tools for improving content creation, practical and effective content migration strategies and template-driven options for building and managing government websites.
