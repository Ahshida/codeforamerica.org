				<h3>Project description</h3>
				<p>Philadelphia received a $1Million grant from <a href = "http://mayorschallenge.bloomberg.org/index.cfm?objectid=7E9F3B30-1A4F-11E3-8975000C29C7CA2F">Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayoral Challenge</a> in 2012 to FastFWD; an accelerator program that enables social entrepreneurs to collaborate with cities to source, cultivate, and deploy solutions to pressing issues facing cities across the country (Initially entitled, Philadelphia Social Enterprise Partnership (PSEP)).</p>
				
				<h3>Problem statement</h3>
				<p>The impetus, for what eventually became a procurement reform movement in Philadelphia, was the desire to make the city a potential market for startups. To do so, however, required “building up the demand side” of the equation; making the city a more viable partner for testing and business. These efforts, in turn, led to the broader effort of procurement reform in Philadelphia.</p>
				
				<p>Initially proposed as the Philadelphia Social Enterprise Partnership (PSEP), the FastFWD program was seeks to reform the procurement process of local government. Under the traditional procurement system, government takes on the role of both presuming to completely understand the problem and prescribing solutions. This system, however, does not invite an opportunity for innovation and creative problem solving to address many social issues. A <a href = "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/city-of-philadelphia-launches-fastfwd-challenges-entrepreneurs-to-address-public-safety-issues-229900381.html">challenge</a> that will only increase in importance "[a]s cities face greater challenges with increasingly fewer resources, [making] the need for entrepreneurial innovation [even] greater."</p>
				
				<p>The proposal put forth by FastFWD frames the conflict such that government entities and entrepreneurs lack a shared language through which to communicate. For example, “[g]overnments define problems...but are structurally unsuited to attracting and sustaining innovation.” By contrast, “entrepreneurs seek opportunities...but may not be aware of social issues that need the most attention.” FastFWD addresses this issue through a “framework [that] brings together government officials with entrepreneurs and policy experts to identify persistent urban challenges and reframe them as opportunities for innovators and entrepreneurs from around the country.” In so doing, this approach seeks to rethink not just how specific social issues are solved, but how the entire procurement process can be restructured to facilitate the crowdsourcing of solutions to social issues.</p>

				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>The vision outlined in the grant proposal sought to address issues around “(1) reforming city procurement requirements, targeting barriers to risk-taking and the testing of innovative ideas; (2) redefining the way in which the city frames our challenges; and (3) creating new networks between city government and entrepreneurial problem solvers.” Philadelphia launched the FastFWD accelerator program to provide a formal structure for stakeholders, the city, entrepreneurs, and others, to work together to address these issues.</p>
				
				<p>In practice, these needs were translated into three desired outcomes for the accelerator program. The first objective is to motivate social entrepreneurs to work on city urban challenges. The second objective seeks to develop models and templates other cities could replicate in order to make city operations and processes more open to innovative and entrepreneurial solutions. This would have the added benefit of creating shared policies around the country for startups to create scalable solutions. Finally, the third objective has the goal of establishing Philadelphia as a central hub for the social enterprise movement.</p>

				<p>As part of the grant proposal, Philadelphia provided a list of metrics and measurements. The metrics for success are defined under two categories, anticipated Outputs and Outcomes. Key areas to be measured are further subdivided under different categories, including (i) accelerator program metrics: the number of companies submitting applications, completed the program, &amp; contracts entered; (ii) company specific metrics: contract specific milestones, funding raised, &amp; contracts executed; and, (iii) external and internal surveys: participant and department feedback, satisfaction, etc. Please see the grant proposal for more details.</p>
				
				<h4>Problems/Issues</h4>
				<p>The City of Philadelphia submitted a grant proposal in response to a call for proposals from the <a href = "http://mayorschallenge.bloomberg.org/index.cfm?objectid=7E9F3B30-1A4F-11E3-8975000C29C7CA2F">Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayoral Challenge in 2012</a>. There were 305 total applicants; five cities were selected. Philadelphia received $1 million dollars to support the initiative for the next several years. The grant proposal, and ensuing project, is led by Story Bellows, Co-Director, Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, City of Philadelphia. Additional support was provided by the <a href = "http://www.phila.gov/mayor/grants.html">Mayor’s Office of Grants</a> to draft the grant proposal. </p>
				
				<p>The proposal was submitted as a collaborative effort amongst three groups. These stakeholders included the New Urban Mechanics Philadelphia/Mayoral Office, Good Company Group, a social enterprise accelerator, and Wharton Social Impact Initiative (WSII) at the University of Pennsylvania. The grant proposal also noted the support of the Philadelphia Program Director of the Knight Foundation. The purpose of working together was to leverage the respective strength of each entity, this includes political support of the city, community leadership in the startup community, and research/academic support from a local university.</p>
				
				<p>Working with Good Company and Wharton led to two significant changes in the process and proposal. First, working with Good Company allowed the City to launch an accelerator program. The Good Company managed accelerator program is a 12-week program; this program allows for more experimentation and innovation because early stage companies can ask questions and receive feedback from relevant government agencies to inform product development. Second, the WSII provided industry focused research that changed how the City framed problems to be solved. This new approach enabled the city to describe problems with a business model approach, as opposed to government approach. For instance, the city focused on public safety ($1.8 billion), because this would support a core function; it also connected the companies to city operations rather than just doing innovation for the sake of innovation. (This lesson resonates with the Multi-Cities Innovation Challenge lessons as well.)</p>
				<p>More specific to the grant proposal, there were two key changes to the original grant submission.</p>
				
				<p>1. The vision of the proposal was narrowed. The original proposal had a two-part goal: (i) reform municipal procurement and (ii) establish Philadelphia “as a hub for social entrepreneurship.” The final submission focused on reforming government to make it more accepting of innovation and “unproven solutions.”</p>
				
				<p>2. The long-term concept of FastFWD sought to test new standards and systems to support government innovation. The original proposal adopted only a slight change from the traditional procurement process. The approach was to announce “instances of innovation”; under this system, the City planned on issuing specific challenges for entrepreneurs to address, and then “partner[ing] with an accelerator to develop the entrepreneurs’ ideas into companies, providing seed funding at the end of the process.” Based on feedback, however, this model was found to be overly restrictively. Instead, the approach changed to the core issues and now seeks develop new standards and systems that bake-in innovation.</p>
				
				<p>In its current cycle, the project operates as an accelerator. Companies applied using the F6s platform (same platform used at MCIC). Twenty applicants were pre qualified based on the request for quotations (RFQ). From those (20) applicants, (10) companies were selected to participate in the accelerator and each received a $10,000 stipend.</p>
				
				
				<h3>Costs &amp; Savings</h3>
				
				<p>The initial costs for the program were limited to staff costs for putting together the grant proposal. The $1million grant covers the set up costs for the program and is supplemented by additional outside sources of revenue, both in-kind and private cash (unspecified sources). The Department of Information Technology spent some additional funds looking at procurement overall. But those costs were not directly related to this initiative.</p>
				<p>Because the program is less than a year old, it is too early to determine final costs or to anticipate any money that will be saved. Conversations with co-Director Story Bellows, however, indicated a desire to find ways to assess the economic impact of the program. Two specific areas mentioned for study include, how has FastFWD supported the launch of local startups? And, what, if any, job growth has FastFWD stimulated in Philadelphia?</p>
				<p>The grant provides sufficient financial support to operate for one year. The majority of the costs are for Personnel (Managing Director) and Implementation (company stipends and personnel costs for Good Company). The grantees anticipate needing a full time city staff member at some point in the future, as part of the general line item budget. Planning has not yet extended beyond that timeframe. For more details, please see the proposal’s attached budget.</p>
				<p>A total of (10) companies were accepted into the program.</p>

					<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
				</div>

				<p>While the long-term impact is yet to determined (as of writing, the MCIC was launched less than a year ago and is just completing its first cycle), three tentative outcomes are discussed below, and two valuable emergent outcomes were identified from the process of building the MCIC. </p>

				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<h4>Results</h4>

				<p>Because the initiative was prepared as part of a grant proposal, metrics were defined to evaluate success. At this point, however, it is too early to draw any conclusions. December 2014 would be a good time to circle back as the first cycle will be complete. Going forward, the organizers have adopted a two-part framework to think about objectives and metrics. And while the details are still not certain, it is useful to note the approach the organizers adopted. The first part was termed as “theoretical” -what do we [the organizers] want to achieve? The second part was termed as “practical” -how do we fit these entrepreneurs into current systems and processes?</p>
				<p>Insofar as emergent outcomes, one of the goals of the initiative was to increase city government’s internal culture and infrastructure to support innovation. The organizers, however, found the application of the proposal to Bloomberg led to immediate changes in government; the “foundation of innovation and its proliferation in our government on which we are building our idea…has strengthened immeasurably since our original submission.”</p>
				<p>The growth of an internal culture within city agencies was critical. New stakeholders were identified and have become involved. The cultural change has brought additional, and different, perspectives (e.g. legal) that have had a good impact on nurturing the program. Although it took time to find people that understood the initiative, the proposal helped unearth those individuals and find others now interested in the process.</p>
				<p>Notably, the organizers found that going forward “will require [an] integrated collaborative approach [by city agencies] to identify problems and to develop and test different solutions.” This is because success requires finding and working with “those people running the day to day core operations of the city.”</p>




				<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
				
				
				<p>At this stage, it is too early to draw final conclusions. But in the process of drafting, submitting, redrafting, and initiating the initiative, lessons can be gleaned for integration into future iterations. Two lessons already being incorporated into the next iteration and three lessons extracted, but not yet fully developed.</p>
				<p>1. 	Work directly with the procurement department earlier in the process. Philadelphia has a bifurcated procurement process, one system works with product purchase and one works with service contracts. The two groups are independent of each other and operate different internal systems. This two-part approach makes the procurement process more complicated than other cities. The system exists for good reason -because of rules and protections to protect the city. Nonetheless, it makes it difficult to fast track startups through the process and makes scalable processes more difficult. Going forward, the organizers plan to (i) work with the procurement process earlier, to develop internal systems; and, (ii) to find ways create shared processes internally in order to scale that process, before providing recommendations to other cities. Equally important, the procurement department cannot be circumvented. Rules and regulations mean the procurement department’s influence persist throughout government processes, contract amounts, and culture. As a result, the organizers are adopting a more engaged approach with the procurement process going forward.</p>
				<p>2. 	Work with specific departments. The city “took lessons from business folks, e.g. market segmentation.” This led to a narrowing of the mission –procurement for the sake of innovation and increasing experimentation in areas departments have mandate and control over. By contrast to the initial goal of “fixing everything.” By focusing efforts in one area, public safety, at least to start, the organizers were able to concentrate their efforts on articulating specific problems, provide startups with more information to develop solutions, and focus efforts around long-term solutions that were sustainable. Equally important, the focus on one agency created buy-in for that agency to participate as well because their interests were involved. (This resonates with Portland’s approach of working with larger departments with their own capital funding.)</p>
				
				
				
				<h4>Early lessons</h4>
				<p>1. 	Early stage companies need a “prequalification” check to be sure they are submitting the to proper departments, answering questions properly, and adequately prepared for a contract. Organizers are exploring new approaches to contracting via a request for qualifications (RFQ). It is hoped that this process –vetting early stage companies before contracting - will enable all parties to identify those projects best prepared for the official procurement.</p>
				<p>2. 	Find other interested stakeholders sooner. It is critical is to get different perspectives. It takes time to find people “to get behind” the ideas of the initiative, but once involved, they have become engaged in the process.</p>
				<p>3. 	There is a great need for the ability to experiment in the area of law and policy. But it’s very difficult to know how to do so.</p>

					<h2 id="next">Next Steps</h2>
				</div>

				<p>FastFWD is as collaborative effort amongst several <a href = "http://fast-fwd.org/about/">entities</a>. It is anticipated that the grant funding from the Bloomberg Philanthropies will be sufficient to launch the program, identify replaceable and scalable lessons, and demonstrate the value to the city of Philadelphia and the civic tech ecosystem generally.</p>

				<p>Going forward, sustaining the program will require committed leadership and resources from the City of Philadelphia. Based on immediate feedback from the startup community, the organizers anticipate needing a full time position funded by the city of Philadelphia. This position would operate from the Office of Innovation and Technology.</p>
			
				<p>The person in this role would serve as the liaison between the startup/entrepreneur community and the city of Philadelphia. The need for this role evolved based on feedback from applicants to the accelerator program. Applicants highlighted a need for support (“handholding”) through the procurement process. As smaller companies, they lacked the institutional knowledge to manage the nuances of the procurement process; and, the companies lacked the resources to customize their proposals to various departments –or at least, to anticipate the individualized needs of each department. The liaison role would serve as the bridge to provide information to the startup community, while also connecting startups to the proper individuals within the government apparatus.</p>
