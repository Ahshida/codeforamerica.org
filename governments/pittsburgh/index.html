    <p>The ways in which governments buy what they need is a fundamental part of how they function. Improving procurement requires addressing the basics, which carries implications for the ways governments provide quality service to their citizens. The Code for America team in Pittsburgh is partnering with the City of Pittsburghâ€™s Office of Innovation and Performance and the RK Mellon Foundation to help tackle these problems.</p>

        <p>I am honored and excited that Pittsburgh is joining with Code for America to build the city's reputation for innovation and transparency. We look forward to working in particular on new approaches to procurement that drive increased community participation, and in so doing, build the digital capabilities of our great city. I know the Fellows can learn from us -- and us from them -- as we work together to make government better for city residents.&rdquo;</p>
