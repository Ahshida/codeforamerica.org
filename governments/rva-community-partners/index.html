    <p>More than one in four Richmond residents live in poverty. Many of those residents have minimal or no access to basic healthcare, causing illness and disease, that if left untreated, puts unnecessary burdens on the city's emergency rooms and hospitals. The fellows are addressing an existing high barrier to entry into many primary care clinics by developing web applications that allow patients to apply for safety-net health services online while also helping organizations share this information as a means to break down these barriers to services.</p>

        <p>On behalf of leaders across the Richmond region, we are thrilled to be working with CfA to integrate technology and innovation into our approach to improve healthcare access and utilization by our vulnerable populations.  We have an unprecedented opportunity to bring together healthcare, philanthropy, the technology sector and government to engage our community residents in the design of a solution that will fundamentally change the way we interact with the healthcare system.&rdquo;</p>

    <h3>Midyear Report</h3>
    <p>During their first month in Richmond, the fellows met with clinic and hospital staff, patients, researchers, and community organizations. Everyone wants to help patients get primary care and reduce unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits, but they heard that for many people, going to the ED is a better option than primary care. The ED is always open, patients are seen right away, and payment isnâ€™t required up front. Read more about how they are working to make it easier for people to access Primary care clinics in their midyear report.</p>
