        <h3>What we talk about when we talk about Chime</h3>
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
    You may have heard that we were developing a content management system designed for government called ChimeCMS. <strong>Weâ€™ve recently decided to stop development of ChimeCMS. </strong>
    </p>

    <h4>Background: Why Chime?</h4>

    <p>
    Since founding Code for America (CfA) in 2011, we've heard about the problems cities face keeping their websites current for residents who need and expect to do  business with their city online. Last year, we started Digital Front Door, a pilot project from our technology team to assess and  improve how cities communicate and serve residents via their website.
    </p>

    <p>
    The most significant result  from the Digital Front Door Initiative was that a simple, modern CMS designed for the work of government is the best way to make City websites work for resident needs, including the traditionally underserved. Nine months ago, after reviewing available content management systems for government websites, we didn&#x2019;t find any  that met our Design Principles or Practices. This helped us decide to develop  a content management system designed for government: ChimeCMS. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Our recent research and work with 5 bootcamp cities confirmed that there&#x2019;s a real  need for a CMS that meets the needs of local governments. There&#x2019;s also a real need for tools that  improve  content creation, practical and effective content migration strategies and template-driven options for building and managing government websites.
