<h2 class="c2"><a name="h.bpsvf1qfxie3"></a><span>Engineer</span></h2>

<p class="c3"><span>Code for America is changing the&nbsp;way governments and citizens interact. We need your help.</span><br /><br /><span>City websites will become the primary way residents learn about and interact with their local governments.</span><span>&nbsp;Our </span><span class="c7"><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/">Digital Front Door</a></span><span>&nbsp;project is working with cities around the country to make those websites radically better. Part of that is building </span><span class="c7"><a href="http://chimecms.org/">Chime CMS</a></span><span>, an innovative content management and hosting platform that makes it easy for city employees to communicate in ways that work for everyone.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>We need an experienced engineer to help build Chime and,&nbsp;as we grow, mentor future engineers. Your typical week will include quite a bit of designing, coding, and releasing new features. There will be friendly, free-flowing discussions with the rest of your cross-functional team. As we get new clients, you may spin up and test new virtual servers using our automated infrastructure tools. When production errors happen (which we aim to make rare), you will sometimes jump on one, run it down, and check in a fix (where it will be quickly pushed live by our continuous deployment pipeline). Sound like a lot? Don’t worry, we’re big on collaboration, knowledge sharing, and cross-training. And we end every week with a retrospective, so if something’s not working for us, we’ll fix it.</span></p>
