  <h2>About PremierPeso</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>PrimerPeso as a way to help budding new business owners find, identify, and apply for qualified incentives and resources that will help them establish their new venture. The 2014 Fellows found that although the incentives themselves are beneficial, many people were under-informed or confused about how to take advantage of them. PrimerPeso aims to serve entrepreneurs and small business owners who are unaware of the existing available support to start, or grow their business.</p>

  <h2>The Product</h2>
<div class="layout-minim">
  <p>The app initially asks the business owner to reply a set of 10 questions about themselves and their business. It filters through the available incentives and displays a results page customized to the answers. The results page provides information about each incentive such as benefit type, agency delivering, cost of application, requirements, average processing time and more. The business owner can add to their cart as many incentives as wanted and in just one click all of the request will be sent to the agencies involved.</p>
