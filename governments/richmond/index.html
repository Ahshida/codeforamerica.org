More than one in four Richmond residents live in poverty. Many have minimal or no access to basic healthcare, causing preventable illness and disease, that if left untreated, puts unnecessary burden on the city's hospitals. With passing of the Affordable Care Act, it is important for newly enrolled residents to be empowered  to take control of their health. The fellows will work to leverage and align Richmond's many healthcare systems to better serve the needs of low-income residents.
