##Purpose 

When looking at the journey to receiving to food stamps, there are two key steps before the client actually initiates an application for CalFresh benefits: 
1. Awareness  that the CalFresh program exists . 
2. Deciding to apply (which requires an understanding of the program, its eligibility criteria,  and the potential benefits and tradeoffs of participating). 

For many- enrolling for CalFresh begins online through a search engine. We have found that in California each month, there are about 100,000 searches for information about food stamps. They include terms like "calfresh", "cal fresh", "cal fresh eligibility", and "apply for food stamps". 

These searches likely represent Californians who are aware of the program and are searching for more information about how to apply. However, for both generic and city/county specific search terms, online CalFresh applications are not returned as a top result. This makes it challenging to actually apply. 

Most of the top search results are county websites, which act as canonical sources of information about the CalFresh program. However, 84.5% of California's county websites provide incorrect or no information about income criteria for eligibility in food stamps. This guide will help you get your site on track to help prospective CalFresh clients get the right information to deicde if they are eligible to apply.
