Right outside of Boston, Somerville is an award winning city with refined data-driven operations and inclusive community engagement. Code for America will hone in on the educational system to help the Mayor’s team improve the quality of life and health for school-aged children. The fellows will experiment with using data from various sources to enhance the inter and intra school data, sharing capabilities and raising academic outcomes for urban, low-income youth via real-time, data-based interventions for students.

                        &ldquo;In a time of national gridlock where municipalities increasingly need to be the driving force for creative problem-solving and innovation, it’s critical to have a nimble organization like Code for America working directly with cities to develop new solutions and accelerate our progress. Our Fellows will be helping to expand data-based decision-making in our schools to improve outcomes for our students, and we are honored that we were selected to host them.&rdquo;
