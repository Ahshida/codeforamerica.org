## Five general recommendations


### 1. Require an agile, iterative development process that will frequently deliver usable software to users

Many RFPs - even when they try hard not to - end up with a waterfall-like method of specifying requirements at the beginning of a project and lack the ability to recognize of changing user requirements during development or after the service goes live. 

In general, an RFP that reflects a waterfall-like process will have a high risk of producing a solution and process that will not meet the needs of its users. 

Usually, government technology projects take the form of an incredibly complex set of interrelated services. And while typical RFPs might try to describe a successful system (for example, using concepts like distributed web services), such complex services are rarely developed successfully as a complete system, specified in full up-front. 

Instead, services have a much higher chance of success if parts of their functionality can be delivered to users as they are developed rather than as a whole after a long period of development. This is the principle of least surprise: try to structure delivery gradually and frequently rather than as a complete solution in a big bang, even if you are using techniques like pilots. 

If you have an RFP that describes a large, complex system, restructure the RFP to require the development of small pieces of functional software as services that will work together over time. If an RFP already exists, it may already describe smaller services that could stand on their own. 

There is less inherent risk to tackle smaller service areas iteratively and individually, rather than requiring the development of a complete system comprising all of them, and to roll out each service to users when it is ready. Where possible, large RFPs should be split up into smaller contracts, each to deliver individual new services. 

These smaller contracts should then describe discovery, alpha, beta and live phases of service delivery and follow the suggestions of the [U.S. Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) to [structure budgets and contracts to support delivery](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play5).

### 2. Make user research and delivering against user needs a central part of delivery

The State is effectively requesting a new digital workflow for around 24,000 staff and embarking on a massive digital transformation and organizational change project. For such a project to be successful, the development and delivery of new services must be with and for their users. Though the State provides additional documentation such as A Day In The Life of Case Workers and Licensing Workers, there is not enough evidence that the State and successful vendors will conduct user research and user testing to make sure that CWS/NS is simple, clear and easy to use to deliver the anticipated benefits. 
For example, it is unclear how checkpoint builds, quality builds and the user acceptance testing and end-to-end testing phases take into account how the service performs in the hands of its day-to-day users. 

The RFP also shows no emphasis toward user research in general, and hardly any expectation that a successful bidder validate the requirements set by the State. This approach is unlikely to lead to an effective system. 

Instead, the State should: 

make sure that there is user research capability as part of both CDSS and on the vendor’s team;
make clear that the Initiation phase of the project includes discovery, and that the vendor and State should use that time to understand the needs of CWS/NS users
require that the vendor and State work together to use qualitative and quantitative techniques appropriate to the Initiation phase and later phases
require frequent and regular testing of systems with real users during the Solution Development phase to ensure that it meets their needs
structure the Solution Development phase to account for changes that need to be made to the system as a result of user research and testing
3. Open the RFP to allow a completely custom option that is not commercial off-the-shelf software or a transfer system

The State has decided that it will only accept a solution that is mainly commercial off-the-shelf software or a transfer system (a system already built for and being used by another customer) with only a small proportion of custom software. However, what is described in the RFP is a unique set of requirements in a unique environment. We believe the State will reduce the risk of receiving a defective solution by allowing a custom-built service built on top of commodity platform software. 

It may be that a transfer system promises a lower initial cost because it has already been delivered for another customer. It is our belief that a cheaper transfer system will make it more difficult or impossible for the State to get the benefits of a system that it owns, controls and fully understands. Because a transfer system is built on different users’ needs and doesn’t require the State to do as much work in understanding its own users’ needs,  it means that the State will continue to lack an effective understanding of what is required to deliver a successful service. 
4. Simplify bidder requirements to favor a vendor history of delivering large-scale services that meet user needs

Many Administrative requirements of the RFP are designed to reduce the risk of receiving a solution that is not fit-for-purpose. Some ways of reducing this risk are through Key Staff and certification requirements that do not strictly ensure the delivery of good software or services, but instead show that certifications standards have been met. The State should develop the internal capability to assess bidders on their history of delivering large-scale services that meet user needs instead of secondary requirements that will not reduce the risk of bad software being delivered. This internal capability should be met by a multidisciplinary team at CDSS (see recommendation 5). 

5. Move from procuring technology solutions to delivering services

It is clear from the RFP and supporting documentation that responsibility for and management of delivering the CWS-NS solution is spread among many people and groups. In our experience, this had not led to the delivery of effective large-scale digital services. If the intent of CWS-NS is to deliver large-scale positive organizational change in CDSS, then a competent and qualified Digital Director must be appointed with the support of a CWS-NS delivery team. 

The State should:

appoint a CDSS Digital Director with absolute authority over digital services and digital services spending;
create a multi-disciplinary team at CDSS with the authority and responsibility for delivering and iterating upon CWS-NS

This position is inspired by Martha Lane Fox’s letter to Francis Maude, the Minister for the Cabinet Office in the UK that led to the creation of the UK’s Government Digital Service. Lane Fox recommends that this director have the control and power to set standards across CDSS in areas such as:

technical standards: including APIs, data models and security;
content standards: including format, taxonomy, meta-tagging and and rules for syndication partners;
design standards: including usability, accessibility and look-and-feel;
process standards: including content creation, content review processes, SLA and partner processes; and
customer standards: including feedback, consultation, insight, analytics, segmentation and registration.

In particular, this Director should also oversee the re-integration of the spun-out Office of Systems Integration.
