            <p>House Facts is a new civic data standard for building inspections. Local government agencies regulate multiple public health and safety standards on residential buildings to prevent a host of problems from mold to structural habitability. This process generates a vast amount of regualatory data that – if made easily available to the public – could empower prospective tenants or homebuyers and nudge delinquent landlords into compliance.</p>

<p>But currently, for tenants and others working to improve housing conditions, obtaining the regulatory history of a property or landlord is not easy – it requires knowing where to look and contacting multiple government agencies. In this Q&A session, we’ll discuss how a standard format for governments to publish health and safety data for residential buildings so that civic data can easily go where residents are already making decisions and enable government to benefit from new analytic and performance tools.</p>
