           <p>Since 2011, Code for America has partnered with dozens of local governments to apply this approach to deliver better services and outcomes for their communities. We’ve seen that governments of any size, structure, or political persuasion can adopt these practices to better work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century.</p>

              The Rhode Island Department of Education partnered with Code for America to redesign the pre-Kindergarten application process. By starting with research and interviews to understand the needs of parents and school administrators, they created a new user-friendly registration tool called Golden Ticket that saved over 800 hours of parent and staff time and led to a 20% increase in registrations. Golden Ticket helped Rhode Island win $19 million in federal funding to expand from 17 classrooms to 60 between 2015 and 2019, giving more kids a great start in life. Read more
