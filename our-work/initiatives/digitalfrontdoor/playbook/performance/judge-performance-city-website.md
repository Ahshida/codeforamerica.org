Fundamentally, city websites are not merely a broadcasting tool, but a space for interaction, feedback, and resident participation. Through thoughtful design, regular user research with real residents, and continuous improvements based on research, municipal websites can be a pleasant experience for residents to get information and conduct business with government. 
Generally speaking, we believe that city websites should: 

###**Be universally accessible**. 
Simply put, city websites should work for everyone. The information and services on your website should be available to all users, including those with disabilities. They should be easy to use, easy to understand, be available in the major languages spoken by your community, and usable on different devices and browsing technology (i.e. older web browsers). 

Questions to start judging your site’s accessibility:
	
* Does your site offer content in all major languages spoken by your residents?
* Is your site responsive to assistive technologies?
* Does your site provide a consistent experience to desktop and mobile devices (i.e. they have similar bounce rates)?
* Is your site’s content written at an appropriate reading level?
* Is your color scheme accessible for people with color blindness?
* Is your web traffic coming from all over town and in different languages?


###**Establish a sense of place**. 
It’s important for your website to be official, provide up to date content, and act as the authoritative place for conducting city business online.

Questions to start judging your site’s officialness:

* How many pages do you have on your website? 
* Are pages being updated to stay current, or retired when they are no longer needed?
* What is the ratio of content on your homepage that is actionable vs. outdated or not a distinct user need?


###**Provide digital services**. 
City websites should *be* the government, not just provide information *about* the government. 

Questions to start judging your site’s digital services:

* Does your site offer digital services?
* How long does it take to complete the service?
* What is the completion rate (start and finish) of the services that your site provides?
* What is the breakdown in transactions happening online than in-person (in city hall or over the phone?)


###**Treat residents with dignity**. 
City websites should be respectful of residents’ time and offer a simple and delightful experience. When sites have good usability, residents are able to quickly find what they’re looking for. City websites services and content should always provide an opportunity to give feedback. This creates a space for government to learn how to make the site a better experience for users.  

Questions to start judging your site’s respectfulness:

* Are there feedback loops on your site to better understand users’ experience? (i.e. surveys, comment boxes, email address, etc?)
* What is the tone of your site’s content? Is it bossy? Patronizing? 
* How many clicks does it take for a user to find what they are looking for?
* Can users find what they are looking for at all?
* Can residents do what they want to do online?


###**Be resilient**. 
City websites can go down due to hardware malfunction, server mainternance and overload, coding errors, or even unpredictable reasons. You should have a clear action plan on how to address these problems, and how to communicate them out to your users.  
	
Questions to start judging your site’s resiliency:
* When your site is most heavily trafficked? 
* How often is your site down?
* How do you communicate to your residents when your site is not working?
* What is your plan for fixing web errors and malfunctions?
* What is the tone of your error messages? 
* If digital services are currently unavailable, does your site provide alternative ways for residents to perform the transaction?
