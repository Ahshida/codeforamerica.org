Listed below are seven principles that promote good digital products and practices in government. 

We’ve based these principles on how successful governments, vendors and products are working together to deliver 21st Century Government. 
    
### 1. Design for and with people

New Govtech products are focused on understanding and delivering against user needs - whether government employees or residents. These products strive for interfaces that are humane, respectful and so simple and easy to use that a user is able to succeed the first time, unassisted. These products are designed with user needs of the diverse set of residents and government staff who will utilize the products. 


### 2. Deliver More for Less 

Big IT is what government is used to. Expensive — in the hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars range — slow to deliver and often unfit for purpose. When software and hardware is cheaper everywhere, government technology cannot be the exception. New Govtech products should deliver an immense  100x improvement in pricing and value over legacy “Big IT.”. 

As well as price, massive  improvements in value can be delivered by vendors and governments using different business models, and discovering new giteconomies of scale. 

### 3. Enable Data-Driven Government 

All government services should be monitored in real time for speed, availability and effectiveness in achieving the aims of legislated policy. 

New Govtech products deliver relevant, actionable data quickly in real time so that governments can iterate on and improve their services. 

### 4. Use and Promote Open Standards 

Open makes things better. New Govtech products reject proprietary file formats and closed standards and instead use and promote open standards to deliver a collaborative digital platform for government. 

When governments collect data and make it available to the public, they should follow the [8 Principles of Open Data](http://opengovdata.org). 

### 5. Use Clear and Simple Contracts, and Contract Quickly, Transparently and Candidly

New Govtech products strive to be easy to sell and easy to buy. Contract terms should include:

 - be in easy to understand language
 - include transparent, predictable pricing 
 - flexibility for startups/SMEs
 - what types of insurance (auto insurance?)
 
Doing business should be easy, not hard. A long sales or purchase cycle is a symptom of an inefficient system. Governments and vendors both benefit when they are transparent about the amount of time things will take. Vendors and governments should work to get to signed contracts within:

 - 3 months for local government
 - 6 months for state government
 - 9 months for the federal government. Companies should additionally consider the benefits of being on the GSA Schedule for working with the Federal Government.

### 6. Continuously Improve

New Govtech products are services that continuously improve, not shrinkwrapped software. Improvement through regular, small iteration reduces risk, makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons. 

By using services that continuously improve, government services can continually improve for free, without having to do any heavy lifting. 

### 7. Leverage Open-source and Existing Solutions When Appropriate

These companies don’t re-invent products or systems that can be effectively and strategically outsourced.
