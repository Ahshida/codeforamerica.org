Code for America promotes the Fellowship program and then receives applications from governments that are interested in participating. Once the application cycle is complete, we select which governments to work with based upon pre-established selection criteria. We try to get a lot of different cities throughout the U.S. interested in the program because we work with multiple cities (between 8 and 10) simultaneously.

We mainly work with local governments at the city and county level because we have found that local governments interact the most with everyday people and we want to help these governments to improve their digital services.

## The application process

Code for America aims to both have the best applications, and as many as possible. We encourage many cities to apply even if funding is unclear, as we can help them figure that out later on in the process. Also, many first time applicants become cities in future rounds if they don’t make it the first time. In terms of communications, between January and April,  we expect to have approximately 7-12 communications with the cities who are going through the application process, 3-4 times a month.

We use the following criteria to determine which cities applying to the Fellowship program we should work with:

 - Strong leadership and support for the program
 - Internal sponsorship by key people in and outside of the department fellows would partner with
 - A potential for impact and general project scope that aligns with our [focus areas](/focus/)
 - Confirmed or promised budget (these normally include prospective matching funds)
 - A clear understanding of Code for America's approach
 - Demonstrated interest and evidence for improving digital services in tangible ways


## Laying the Groundwork for Good Government Partners

Government officials may not be familiar with the working style of Code for America fellows (agile methodologies, etc). Explaining these and concepts like “emergent outcomes” are important first steps. Another key component is supporting interested government officials in their own work “selling up or selling down,” helping them approach government officials who may be higher or lower in their city’s hierarchy. The fellowship team helps government officials do this mainly by giving them experience and coaching them on how the fellowship can have a positive impact. They provide them with stories, data points, and other information from previous successful projects (such as press clippings, stories about impact). Specifically, they choose a couple of officials within government who can be an internal evangelist of Code for America and the program and give them examples of past projects that are most relevant to their own situation.

After developing these internal champions (which is 50% salesmanship and 50% coaching), the Fellowship Team coaches the cities in getting someone in a senior role into discussions about bringing the fellowship to that city. This usually begins as a phone conversation with both the internal evangelists and the senior person on their team on the line. From that conversation Code for America helps flesh out that team’s motivations and blockers so that we can help them navigate the application process and how to get the project funded.

### High Level Government Officials

It is important to partner with mayors and other high-level government officials early on because they can connect and influence other government departments who might be interested in collaborating with the fellows. Mayors in the U.S. generally understand what’s happening at the ground level in their governments and have the political capital to get others signed on.

It is ideal to approach mayors shortly after an election. In our experience, mayors get excited about the program because they want innovation in their governments, and to be known as trying to “do things differently” with a new policy agenda. They oftentimes hope to use that to carry momentum for their term. Creating positive public relations opportunities such as photo-ops and media attention are helpful in working with mayors and other high level government officials.

Established tech executives in your community can be helpful in facilitating introductions to these officials (just getting your foot in the door to pitch to an official at that level can be hard). In CfA’s earlier years, we relied heavily on our Board member’s networks. Today, government officials who have participated in the program are extremely useful in getting others on board. On a case-by-case basis, CfA can help to facilitate introductions between mayors in other countries and those in the U.S. who can attest to the value of participating in the fellowship program.Here are some general tips for pitching a fellowship program to high level government officials:

 - Identify their biggest challenges to governing and suggest different ways that technology could help solve them.
 - Highlight potential for positive publicity from participating in the program.
 - Articulate the program as a way to help them achieve high-level goals and objectives.
 - Frame the Fellowship as a way inspire a culture of innovation that can sweep through their local government.
 - Emphasize opportunities to increase efficiency, lower costs, enhance civic engagement and foster innovation.
 - Share examples of success stories, either from your own work or from similar initiatives. For example, a [list of "wins"](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah1olKDkcI9WdE1MVHl5ZGQ5LS1TZzRiQjU3Q2ZfX0E&usp=drive_web#gid=1) from Code for America programs and videos of [apps and stories](/products/) from past Code for America projects.
 - Invite them to come speak at an event and build their enthusiasm for your program.

### Government Officials in Middle Management

Middle managers typically from the government IT Department, like an IT Manager, or from the larger government bureaucracy, like a Policy Manager) are crucial to government programs. In our experience it’s sometimes hard for them to envision how the Fellowship program could be useful for their work. These officials have frequently been charged with safekeeping data and preserving processes which can seem in direct contrast with the Fellowship program. Generally, staff from the government IT department are resource-constrained so they initially see the only value in collaborating with the Fellowship program being an opportunity for their team to contribute to executing something specific and meaningful. The emphasis on cultivating and nurturing “emergent outcomes” that comes out of the Fellowship program is difficult to sell to this constituency. Many times higher level officials have been helpful to us in getting mid-level managers on board.Here are some tips for pitching the Fellowship program to middle-management government officials (a lot of these strategies are helpful for more senior government officials too):

#### Frame the opportunity

In CfA’s early days we made the mistake of presenting the program as CfA fellows “fixing government.” The Fellowship program should always be presented as a partnership between two groups that are passionate about public service and want to make a difference in their communities. The emphasis on collaboration and participatory processes should be established at the very beginning.

#### Give concrete examples

You can find examples of Code for America successes in this government <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1YiVsG_l7DXGvwnAq_kPjxnR3HmTvLz_N6wxsigF0SLY/edit">Guide on the Fellowship</a>, which is a handbook we prepare and distribute to government partners (present and potential).

#### Show value in existing data

Focus on “non-controversial” datasets first. For example, if they have a dataset that lists all of the times and dates that garbage is picked up, explain how that dataset could be used as an input to an SMS application that can remind residents to take out their trash on that day. If you have the resources, it’s even better to show these “quick-wins” and build something simple that will give officials a clear picture of what can be accomplished.

#### Make friends

Try to get to know officials on a personal level. It will help to better understand the constraints facing their department, what they’re passionate about and what issues they’d like to work on. Find examples of civic tech innovations that could address those issues or brainstorm ideas for future projects that could be effective at leveraging technology to solve their problem.

#### Target specific roles

Target outreach efforts to Innovation Officers, Chief Data Officers, and Chief Digital Officers (or their equivalent). People with these roles can be very effective allies and can help advance your cause.

#### Build a relationship with local groups

For example, see if your community has a local <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Brigade</a> chapter. They can connect you with officials and help alleviate concerns about longterm sustainability of the project.

#### Avoid jargon, buzzwords and clichés

When you approach people in government about a fellowship program, it’s important to be mindful of the language you use. If you have a technology background, don’t make any assumptions about a government official’s degree of technical expertise. Avoid using terms such as open source, GitHub issues, API, prototyping, agile development and other “jargon” unless you take the time to explain the meaning. These terms are commonplace in the technology world but are mostly foreign to government workers. Using tech-heavy terminology can be isolating, patronizing and, most importantly, derail the potential for collaboration.

## Approaching Potential Partners

The road to contracting with government partners differs a lot with each potential partner. When CfA first started out, we used personal networks, our Board, and publicity from speaking at events like government conferences to drum up interest in our programs. Now that we have a reputation for the work we’ve done, things play out a bit differently. Here are some examples to give you an idea of how we form partnerships with government partners.

### Somerville

Somerville approached us to get involved in Code for America’s <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/">Digital Front Door</a> project. Code for America couldn’t work with them on that project, but we identified that Somerville officials wanted access to new tech and new ways of doing things. Our Fellowship team helped them understand how the Fellowship could support them in accomplishing their goals. They’re currently one of our <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/2015-cities/">2015 Fellowship cities</a>.

### Indianapolis

In Indianapolis, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana (a previous Code for America partner) sent a letter to the mayor of Indianapolis recommending that the city work with Code for America. This opened up a conversation with the mayor of Indianapolis about how partnering with CfA could help make progress towards goals they had for improving public safety in the city. This is an example of how government officials you’ve worked with in the past can be important advocates by introducing you to people in their network and by speaking on your behalf.

### Richmond

In Richmond, the government officials there had applied previously for CfA’s Fellowship program but weren’t selected because there wasn’t a clear and specifically scoped out problem that the Fellowship program could help to solve. The Fellowship team kept Richmond engaged with Code for America through the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/peernetwork/">Peer Network</a> (our network of government officials who receive trainings through webinars and connect to each other about how to use technology to better solve civic issues). They also kept in touch with government contacts in Richmond, educating them about our model, and working to better understand their thinking about the impact they want to make using technology. It was a long process of building the relationship and scoping out a possible project. We were eventually able to figure out a place where their needs overlapped with what the Fellowship program could offer and Richmond is a 2015 Fellowship city.
