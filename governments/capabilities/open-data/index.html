			<p>When public data is made freely available in open, standardized formats, it can drive transparency, community engagement, and accountability. Governments around the country are building a culture and commitment to openness in City Hall across departments by making government data openly and easily available to citizens — and supporting open data with process and technology.</p>
			<p>In this guide, we’ll explain some of the practical tactics and considerations you’ll need to know to get an open data initiative off the ground in your city or county, drawing upon the experience and expertise of other governments who have successfully done so.</p>

	<h3>Introduction: What is open data, and why bother?</h3>
	</div>
	<p>Government data is a valuable public resource that, when accessible by every community member, can be a powerful tool to support the goals and values of the community. Cities and counties around the country are making an effort to ensure the data they hold is freely and easily available to the public by embracing and institutionalizing the practice of “open data.”</p>
	<p>What is open data? Basically, open data refers to data (such as documents, databases, records, or transcripts, including those managed by outside vendors) released by a government or organization that is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>freely available to be used, shared, and reused by anyone for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.</li>
		<li>available in digital, machine-readable formats (such as .csv) so that it can be used in combination with other data and applications.</li>
		<li>available in its entirety — and able to be downloaded “in bulk” and not just manually retrieved record-by-record.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are many benefits of opening data. By opening data in machine-readable formats, governments can:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Build new avenues for civic engagement and participation (technologists can use the data to build or deploy an existing app).</li>
		<li>Create internal efficiencies and save money by creating a centralized place those inside and outside government can easily find the information they need.</li>
		<li>Be a platform for new apps, services, and businesses to be built upon, spurring economic development.</li>
		<li>Increase transparency and trust between government and community. </li>
		<li>Make important and useful community information more accessible to residents. </li>
		<li>Reduce the burden on government staff to respond to repetitive public records requests by making frequently-requested information available to residents in a self-serve format.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These are just a few of the reasons your government might decide to pursue an open data initiative. In this guide, we’ll explain some of the practical tactics and considerations you’ll need to know to get an open data initiative off the ground in your city or county — drawing upon the experience and expertise of other governments from around the country who have successfully done so.</p>
