            In Jamaica, praedial larceny (the theft of agricultural produce and livestock) costs the Jamaican agriculture industry more than US$5 million each year. Strategic police checkpoints are supposed to help deter against this rampant theft and protect the farmers in their community.  However, police receive inconsistent access to people in the office who can provide the data they need to make judgment calls in the field. They need to know whether the receipt they are given is valid  or fake - the first validating a legitimate sale and the second cluing the officer into the possible existence of theft. This renders them virtually ineffective in distinguishing between those that steal and those that purchase goods legally, dissuading their efforts to deter against praedial larceny.</p>

          <p>Slashroots implemented the Code for the Caribbean fellowship program to solve problems such as this. They recruited, trained and mentored three fellows who partnered with government officials from Jamaica’s Ministry of Agriculture, the Rural Agriculture Development Authority (RADA) to address this problem. First, they integrated all of the farmer registration and invoice information into one database and created an interface that they could build an application on top of: Harvest API.</p>
          <p>The CftC fellows then developed CLIP, a tool that gives police officers the information they need to differentiate between the legitimate or illegitimate transport of goods in an instant. By using CLIP, a police officer who stops someone at a checkpoint can immediately input the invoice number into their cell phone and receive a text message confirming whether or not the receipt was legitimate. By providing the police with lightweight tools and thereby leveraging technology, they are not only saving the government money but helping to re-establish trust between farmers and the police officers tasked with protecting their livelihoods.</p>
