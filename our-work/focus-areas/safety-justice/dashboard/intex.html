  <h2>About the Jail Dashboard</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>Originally built with Louisville in partnership with the Laura and John Arnold Foundation to address jail overcrowding and provide insight into the jail population profile, the dashboard helps the jail administrator, judges and other stakeholders understand the conditions in the metro jail and use this data to visualize how their decisions - at both the individual and policy level - affect program, facility and inmate outcomes.</p>

  <h2>The Product</h2>
  <p> Features enable  stakeholders to: (1) visualize and compare the existing capacity of the jail and of  alternatives to incarceration programs, so that judges can better decide where to place each defendant; (2)  track who is where, across the entire jail population and; (3)  understand population  trends, as well as filter the data by gender, age, court, sentence status or length of stay.</p>
