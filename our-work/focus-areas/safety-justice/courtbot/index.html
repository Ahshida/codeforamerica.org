  <h2>About CourtBot</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>Originally built with the city of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/atlanta/" target="_blank">Atlanta</a> in partnership with the Atlanta Committee for Progress to simplify the process of resolving a citation for any citizen wanting to do their civic duty to pay their traffic fines. People are typically unsure if they even need to appear in court, when that appearance day might be, how much the fine will cost, or the process of contending the citation. The default is often to show up at the courthouse and means waiting in hours of lines. Courbot allows the public to pay their citations on the spot, via a text message.</p>

				<p>Folks take off work, they arrange for child care, they head down to municipal court, to wait in a line. Imagine what it’s like standing in that line with bad weather, or when it’s windy out, or when you’ve cut it just close to make it to your 8am docket time. So, in Atlanta, you see folks show up for court, and stand in line.</p>
