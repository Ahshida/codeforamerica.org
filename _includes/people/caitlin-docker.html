      Caitlin joined Code for America in November 2015 to build and launch the Economic Development's Community of Practice, which is  organized around two primary themes: streamlining government services for entrepreneurs and bridging the skills gap through the publicly funded workforce system. Caitlin will document best practices from the 2016 fellows and Brigades while facilitating a space where civic leaders and others can share lessons, challenges, and innovations. 

Before joining Code for America, Caitlin worked as a Senior Account Executive at GMMB, focusing on corporate social impact and issue communications. She has more than four years of experience supporting communication initiatives, including message and content development, earned and digital media strategy, and advertising. She brings strong organizational, facilitation, and project management skills, with a specialty in working with partners, grantees, and community members. Caitlin received her Bachelor of Arts in Communications Media and Spanish from American University in Washington D.C.
