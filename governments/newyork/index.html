    <h2>The 2016 Fellowship in New York</h2>
  </header>
  <p>New York City is engaging Code for America to help low-income families find and retain affordable housing. CfA will work with the City to build a tool that integrates the data and services from the multiple departments and agencies responsible for providing affordable housing to NYC residents. The tool will search for program eligibility checks, referrals, and applications, and will improve case manager workflow and collaboration between city departments. This project is aligned with the City’s efforts to create Community Health Hubs for greater interdepartmental service delivery to meet people in their own neighborhoods - the greatest predictor of community health in NYC and across the nation. The partnership will also clarify the needs of providers, City agencies, and residents, and develop new, modern digital tools to meet these needs.</p>

    <h2>The 2013 Fellowship in New York</h2>
  </header>
    <p>In 2013, The City of New York partnered with Code for America to enlist a team of fellows to build technology to address criminal justice issues. The fellowship was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/cjc/html/home/home.shtml">Mayor’s Office of the Criminal Justice Coordinator</a> and the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/html/home/home.shtml">Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications</a>. Support and funding were provided by the <a href="http://www.arnoldfoundation.org/">Laura and John Arnold Foundation</a> and <a href="http://brfny.org/">Blue Ridge Foundation</a>.</p>
    <p>NYC fellows CJ Bryan, Doneliza Joaquin, and Ezra Spier quickly learned about the complex matrix of criminal justice stakeholders at the state, city, and borough levels. With the help of their city contact Jordan Dressler, General Counsel at the Mayor’s Office of the Criminal Justice Coordinator, the fellows met with stakeholders in all five boroughs in their office and in the courtrooms&nbsp;– from NYPD staff, district attorneys, and judges to defense attorneys, court staff, and nonprofits and advocacy organizations.</p>
    <p>As part of their residency, the fellows met with Alternative to Incarceration providers that are contracted with the city to provide eligible criminal defendants an opportunity to avoid jail or prison through participation in community-based social services programs directed at their specific needs.</p>
    <p>To find defendants who are eligible for a specific program, ATI staff currently must go from courtroom to courtroom to review paper versions of packets of criminal complaints, rap sheets, court calendars, as well as field referral calls and emails from judges, prosecutors , and defense attorneys. Only after a staff member has identified eligible candidates can he or she interview them to determine if they are a good fit for the program. This time-consuming process can lead to missed opportunities to connect eligible candidates with the services they need.</p>
    <p>In response, the CfA team built Criminal Case Search, a web application that enables ATI program staff to run customized real-time searches of criminal case information like defendant demographics, criminal history, charge data, and court scheduling information. With Criminal Case Search, ATI program staff can identify and locate program-eligible candidates for the first time from their offices or via their mobile devices. Leveraging the data on the City’s Datashare platform, the filtering tool sifts through the data remotely according to user-defined criteria, producing easy-to-read lists of eligible program candidates and allowing program personnel more time to speak with and match candidates to their programs.</p>
    <p>The fellowship team also attended and participated in a number of civic tech events, including Code Across America, #betaNYC meetups and hack nights, DataKind meetups, Civic Service Forum, and the New York Tech Meetup.</p>
