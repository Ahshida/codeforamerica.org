Your online content (both text and media) is a representation of your city and the services it delivers. During a website redesign, content isn't just migrated over once- it's an ongoing process of analyzing, refining, updating, and even deleting. Here's some steps to startbuilding great content on your site. 

##1. Understand User Needs
Start with understanding your usersâ€™ online needs. By conducting an [online resident survey](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/playbook/user-needs/run-a-resident-survey.html), you can assess the devices and types of internet access used in different parts of your city, evaluate user needs to prioritize content development on your site, and understand where your city has strong and weak connections to users of its website. 

##2. Conduct a Content Audit
Conducting a content audit provides a quantitative understanding of how various webpages on your site are performing. It can help you determine which pages need to be pruned or consolidated on your site, which pages need to be rewritten, which pages are the most heavily trafficked, identify any gaps, etc. 

In general, your content audit process should: 

* Collect all URLs on your site. 
* Gather KPIs and other information for each page. We suggest using both our [City Analytics Dashboard](https://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/city-analytics-dashboard/), a free tool that runs on Google Analytics, and [URL profiler](http://urlprofiler.com/), a free third-party tool that will gather various metrics, including:
	* Bounce rate: the percentage of people who landed on a page and left right away (i.e. a one page session)
	* Exit rate: the percentage of people who left your site from a specific page. Exits may have viewed more than one page in a session (i.e. they navigated through your site to a particular page)
	* Unique visitors
	* Word count
	* Sentence count
	* Reading level
	* Number of visits 
* Analyze your content based on its metrics. Assign a specific action to each URL-- such as "keep", "remove", "update", etc. For example, if a page hasn't been accessed in the last year, and isn't legally required information, it should be removed. Pages that have duplicate information and purposes should be consolidated into one page.

##3. Develop a Content Strategy 

Your content strategy should consist of key values that can guide decisions you make about your web's content. This should include: 

* Goals for your content
* Identifying a point person (or department) that will see individual pages
* Regular intervals for going over your web content's analytics with the appropriate staff
* A plan for regularly updating your content
* Methods for conducting ongoing user research to test how users behave with the site's content and features
* Strategies to collect on-going feedback from users about your website
* Criteria for when content can be archived or deleted 
* On-going plans to train and empower best practices around writing for the web 


##4. Create Internal Content Tools
Understanding your users and equipping your content writers with the appropriate tools is essential to delivering top quality content. The U.K.'s Government Digital Service has published some helpful [background research on how users read](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/how-users-read.html
), which helps inform the policies and decisions of their content [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style). Some helpful internal tools for your team might include:

* **Style guide**: A style guide sets the overall voice and tone for your content. It helps your writers understand how to communicate in a consistent and effective way. 
		
* **Reading level tools**: Tools like [Readability-score.com](https://readability-score.com/) can give writers real-time feedback on the clarity and reading level of their content. In general, pages should strive for a 6-8th grade reading level. 

* **Pattern portfolio**: While less specific to your site's written content,  pattern portfolio can help maintain a cohesive and structured visual appearance to your site. 

####Spotlight: Philadelphia
As part of its [alpha.phila.gov](http://www.alpha.phila.gov) redesign process, the City of Philadelphia released a [pattern portfolio](http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/patterns/) that defines and shares common design elements on the site. By releasing a template package of the various styles, colors, and HTML markup features on the site, the City can maintain a consistent aesthetic and consistent experience for users. They also [documented their experience](http://phillyinnovates.com/2015/03/11/alpha-phila-gov-update-4-pattern-portfolio/) building the pattern library on their blog.



##5. Hold Content Writing Sessions

The technical aspects of your website are just one component of your site. At its core, a good city website means that information is accurate and easy to understand. This begins with building a strong writing culture and supporting your staff to be confident web writers. 

Holding content writing workshops can help your team build capability in writing for the web. During these sessions, you can go over your web analytics, and practice writing in a way that's consistent with your style guide. 

You should try to identify representative from the departments of your high trafficked pages to serve as the deparment's designated writer and attend the content workshops. 

###Writing for the Web 
In general, writing for the web means:  

* Using short sentences
* Keeping paragraphs short
* Avoiding jargon and writing in plain English
* Having lots of paragraph breaks
* Using subheadings

####Spotlight: Provo, UT
As part of the City's website redesign, the Mayor worked closely with the team to identify department leads to attend content writing sessions. For ten months, Provo's representatives from each department attended bi-weekly writing workshops. During these meetings, representatives kept individual blogs to build their web writing confidence, learned best practices for streamlined user experience, and practiced using web analytics to inform content decisions for their sites.
