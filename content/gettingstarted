<h2>Starting a Fellowship Program</h2>
<p> After four years of running our program, we've essential elements that contribute to a successful fellowship program: 
<ul>

<li>A robust developer/ technologist community. This includes private sector tech companies or a local <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">CfA Brigade</a> (CfA’s international citizen volunteer program) chapter.</li>

<li>Interest from the technology community to dedicate their time for a year of service.</li>

<li>Interest from local government offices in finding technological solutions to service delivery challenges and fostering civic engagement.</li>

<li>Resources, available budget, and flexible procurement policies that allow government agencies to pay for a fellowship program and fellows' stipdends. In our experience, paying fellows is <b>key</b> to fostering commitment and acquiring a large talent pool for recruiting. </li>

</ul>

<p>If these conditions aren't in place, you might want to consider <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/">other program alternatives</a> before moving forward with a CfA-style fellowship program. Variations of fellowship programs can be found <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/">here</a>.</p>



<h4>The Fellowship Timeline</h4>

<p>Running the fellowship program is an on-going cycle of recruiting fellows and city partners, preparing them for the program, running the program, and beginning the cycle for the upcoming year. Roughly, our timeline include: 
<ul>

<li><b>Preparation (fall)</b>: Get government partners ready for the fellowship experience. We hold an onboarding session during the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/">CfA Summit</a> in the fall, followed by in-city visits. This process includes setting the stage with a broad range of city government staff, aligning community resources, ensuring access to relevant data and setting up logistics like work space, housing, meetings, and access to buildings and IT infrastructure. It also may include some baseline research in areas where we want to have an impact.</li>

<li><b>Fellows Orientation (January)</b>: Prepares fellows for their monthlong residency period in government and for the program overall. This includes an orientation for fellows on <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/">CfA’s programs</a> and approach, trainings about local government and research methodologies, talks from CfA advisors and mentors, and an opportunity to practice collaborating together to build applications.</li>

<li><b>Government Residency (February)</b>: Provides an opportunity for fellows to create relationships with government officials, conduct user research with citizens, develop partnerships with community nonprofits/start-ups, and helps them begin to further scope out the project and start identifying data sets that would be useful for the project. For this phase, fellows live and work in their partner cities. </li>

<li><b>Development Sprints and Mentorship (March–May)</b>: Gives the fellows a chance to build and refine the technology and better scope out the problem they’re trying to solve. When the fellows come back from Residency they begin the development of their first project prototype after whittling their ideas down to a top few. This is when they really start using <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">“lean” principles</a> to build their work. Fellows are also encouraged to use an <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1ybaIrGcUN3e4uWIHSphlx8UhjSCyr1yfcelg7jZ-Kr8/edit">agile development</a> processes and tests to increase the security and rigor of their app projects. These include unit testing, route testing, and integration testing. The tests functioned as a safeguard against unintentional regressions, and also helped to document the expected behavior of the code in clear, concise code. </li>

<br>Staff engage with fellows at this time with recurring trainings, meetings, and one on one chats to continue supporting fellows. Fellows also meet in person with their government partners and community stakeholders to pitch ideas and get project feedback. 

<li><b>Mid-Year Reports and Celebrations (June)</b>: Code for America fellowship teams create a mid-year report on their project progress and metrics. We also host “<a href="http://beta.codeforamerica.org/">BETA</a>”), a small conference that gives the CfA community a chance to learn about what the fellows are working on.</li>

<li><b>Product Sprints and Career Development (July–August)</b>: Fellows continue developing their prototypes and conduct more user research to strengthen their projects. This includes travel as needed to their host cities. CfA staff also support the fellows with connections and ideas about their post-fellowship futures. </li>

<li><b>CfA Summit (September)</b>: The Summit is an annual conference where CfA convenes the global civic tech community. At the Summit, fellows, their government partners, and other civic tech enthusiasts tell their stories to a broader audience. The Summit includes very produced talks that promote the civic tech movement. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCZV9CR4dQ">app demo</a> from our Louisville Kentucky Team in 2013. We also announce our government city partners for the upcoming year at the Summit, and invite their elected officials and local government staff to attend. This gives our future partners a chance to talk to (and learn from) current government partners about the fellowship experience. </li>

<li><b>Transition and Sustainability (October - November)</b>: CfA fellows and staff work finalize effective sustainability mechanisms to keep the project going for the government partner once the fellowship comes to an end. Staff organizes a celebration for the fellowship class, and begings orienting new government partners for the following year. </li>

<h4> Adaptations of the Fellowship Cycle: Mexico City </h4>

<p>If fellows will work in the same place as their government partners all year long, your calendar may look different. For example, the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/partners-cfmc.html">Code for Mexico City Fellowship program</a>, organized by <a href="http://labplc.mx/">Mexico City’s Government Innovation Lab</a> had fellows work in the same city as their government partners for the duration of their fellowship. </p>

<ul>

<li><b>Fellowship promotion, application and selection</b>: The Lab promoted its fellowship program in a variety of ways, including the creation of a special promotional video which was disseminated through official government channels. 150 people completed the Lab’s Fellowship application and five were selected.</li>

<li><b>Problem discovery (1 month)</b>: The fellows worked with their government partners to determine the datasets they would need as inputs for their projects and took the necessary steps to make them available. For this stage, the fellows spent some time doing prep work and then two weeks working side by side with their government partners. </li>

<li><b>Minimum Viable Product (2.5 months)</b>: The fellows used the information they gathered during the Discovery phase to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP was a simple way to explain their idea and to test the viability of their proposed technological solution and collect feedback. </li>

<li><b>Product development (2 months)</b>: Fellows were encouraged to quickly change and refine their product based on  feedback around their MVP. For this portion, the fellows focused their efforts on building out the technical components of their idea and refining the overall graphic design and usability. By the end of this phase, the fellows had created a beta version of their product.</li>

<li><b>Testing (2 months)</b>: The fellows conducted user research to identify bugs and usability issues. They took into account these suggestions and made changes to their applications before handing them off to their government counterparts. </li>

<li><b>App launch and transition to government partners</b>: As the fellowship programs winds down for the year, the fellows work with their government partners to make sure someone from the city is responsible for and equipped to maintain the project. Preparation for this can include technical training for government staff and community organizing with local groups most closely connected to the project. In cities with active CfA Brigade chapters, the members of the local Brigade are key to this transition. Sometimes fellows hold formal launch events for their projects in their cities which is helpful in publicizing the project.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Staffing the Program</h4>

<p>Many staff members work to support the CfA Fellowship program. The main roles and recommended staff profiles are as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Fellowship Program Director</b>: maintains overall strategy,  and oversees partnerships with other CfA programs and with government city partners. It’s ideal for this person to have a work experience or a background in government.</li>

<li><b>Fellowship Program Manager</b>: responsible for overall delivery, creation, and evaluation of the program. This person should be adept at managing interpersonal relationships, and be detail-oriented and organized.</li>

<li><b>Director of Government Relations</b>: markets the program to local governments, supports program applicants, and assist government partners throughout the fellowship program. It’s helpful for this position to be filled by someone with a sales background, extensive communications skills, and a working knowledge of local government.</li>

<li><b>Senior Manager of City Engagements</b>: collaborates with the Director of Government Relations to develop strong relationships with potential government city partners, understand their needs and support them in applying and executing the fellowship program. As with the Director of Govt. Relations, it’s helpful for this person to have a strong understanding of local government and have solid interpersonal skills. </li>

</ul>
