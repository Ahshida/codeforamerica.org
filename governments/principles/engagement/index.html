<p>Code for America works at the intersection of *civic engagement*, *government*, and *technology*.

We build digital tools that improve the public’s interactions with government, and use those tools as a catalyst for structural changes that make government more open, more responsive, and more engaging.</p>

<p>We emphasize the role of the citizen not just as passive recipient of government services, but as active participant in building government.

Neither government staff nor the public are satisfied with current modes of engagement.<!-- Jen's comment <-- --> This is why citizen engagement is one of the top things cities ask for Code for America's help on.

We have seen glimpses of a better model of engagement working in cities across America. Now is the time to systematize effective civic engagement.</p>

## Effective Civic Engagement Strategy Standard##

<p>We think there are five key elements of an effective, 21st century engagement strategy. They are:

1. **Reach:** strategies to include all residents, particularly those who are typically excluded from participating
2. **Information:** providing relevant information that is easy to find and understand
3. **Channels:** making use of a diversity of spaces, both physical and virtual, that meet people where they are
4. **Productive Actions:** having clear and concrete actions residents can take to reach desired outcomes
5. **Feedback Loops:** the public understands the productive impact of their participation, and that their actions have value

Governments must be proficient in all five areas to create meaningful relationships with **all** residents.</p>

## What Success Looks Like ##

<p>When cities fully develop these five capacities, we expect to see:
* Measurable increases in the public’s satisfaction and trust in government
* Improvements in residents’ sense of efficacy - when they see a problem, they feel there is a path to fixing it
* Greater number and kinds of people who participate in public forums
* A stronger consensus of support from the public for government policies, processes, services, and plans
* More engagement around public information
* A more collaborative, less antagonistic relationship between the City and the public
* Public servants feel they have capacity to engage the public in their work</p>

### Reach ###

<p>

###### Checklist ######
Some useful questions to ask around reach include:
* What is the issue we want to engage people with?
* Which voices are being heard the least, or not at all, on this issue?
* How can we identify and invite participation from those voices? <!-- changed to reflect Bracy's comment re: identifying voices -->
* Have we mapped out community constituencies and their connections?
 
###### Strategies ######
* Codify a plan to know who you are trying to reach and how.
* Use your map to identify constituencies that are not engaged on this issue, and build relationships with those constituencies.
* Start with the people least well-served by the issue status quo.
 
</p>

### Information ###

<p>

###### Checklist ######
Some useful questions to ask around information should include:
* Does our outreach answer the most frequently asked questions?
* Do we communicate with an authentic voice in clear language?
* Is our language relevant to different groups in the city?
* Are we tracking and updating our information easily based on feedback?

###### Strategies ######
* Conduct a census of all City information around the relevant issue or service, consolidate, and update.
* Run a write-a-thon to engage many constituencies to do this in clear, people-centered language.
* Source user stories from the people you want to engage.
* When you make your community constituency map, compare your city's Census demographic data with the demographics that engage with the City in meetings and public comment. The gap in representation is where you will find unheard voices. <!-- from Migurski's comment --></p>

### Channels ### <!-- temporarily changed "Forums" to "Channels," but recognize we need a bit more thinking here. "Spaces" is an alternative. -->

<p>

###### Checklist ######
Some useful questions to ask around channels include:
* Are we meeting people where they are, both in real space and online?
* When can we engage people where the issue will be most tangible?
* Do we support many methods for people to communicate proactively?
* Are we authentically joining people at community spaces they trust?

###### Strategies ######
* Ask about transit at the bus stop, housing at a housing fair, and food policy at the farmers market and the SNAP office.
* Find ways for people to engage whenever and wherever they choose.
* Consider different access: mobile, ability, language, social norms.
* Focus on spaces people trust, like churches, libraries, schools, and parks.

</p>

### Productive Actions ###

<p>

###### Checklist ######
Some useful questions to ask around productive actions include:
* What concrete, productive, meaningful actions can people take on the issue?
* Are there a variety of methods for people to use their voices and hands?
* How can we make the hard ask for people to take specific actions?
* How can people co-design tools and services with government?
* Do we have a standard practice for civic user testing?<!-- wonder if this one is a bit tangential -->

###### Strategies ######
* The critical moment for people to participate in government is at the point of clearly advancing towards a shared goal.
* Create opportunities for the public to contribute to advancing desired outcomes. These actions can range from collecting directed feedback on an issue to co-creating government services with residents.

</p>

### Feedback Loops ###

<p>

###### Checklist ######
Some useful questions to ask around feedback loops include:
* Can people see the influence of their investment and engagement on the issue?
* Is there an opportunity for instant feedback in all directions?
* Does the engagement process produce actionable feedback?
* How can you maintain and strengthen the relationship you have created?

###### Strategies ######
* Residents must very clearly see the positive impact of their investment in engagement.
* Implement a shared set of tools that keep residents in the loop about how their inputs are being used.
* Consider city officials as agents of community outreach, constantly building relationships and joining events even when not necessary.
