Your online content is a representation of your city and the services it delivers. During a website redesign, you are not just migrating over old content one time- it is an ongoing process where content will be continuously analyzed, updated, refined, and even deleted. Below is a recommended roadmap for building great content on your site. 

##1. Understand User Needs
Start with understanding your users’ online needs. By conducting an online resident survey, you can assess the devices and types of internet access used in different parts of your city, evaluate user needs to prioritize content development on your site, and understand where your city has strong and weak connections to users of its website. 

Check out our [Run an Online Survey Guide](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/playbook/user-needs/run-a-resident-survey.html) to learn more about what kinds of questions to ask, and how to run the survey. You should aim for a response from at least 1 in 1,000 residents, with geographic, ethnic, and age distributions similar to your [city’s census data](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml). 

Analyze the results of your survey to make sure you are achieving responses that are representative of the entire community. Using zip code data and any socio-economic data collectived from the survey, identiy gaps in your reacy, and work to disseminate the survey to groups who were not accounted for during the initial outreach. You can use tactics in our [civic engagement standard](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/engagement/) to have better reach and a more holistic sample of the community. 


######**Spotlight: Oakland, CA** 

In 2014, Code for America worked with the [City of Oakland](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/oakland-phase1-report) to conduct a resident survey.

An additional survey was shared to city staff to understand their web activities and pain points. A major finding was that many of the city's staff struggle 1. with using the city's content management system and 2. with knowing where information lives on their site. This suggested that the site's information architecture was not helpful or intuitive to neither city staff nor residents. 

From the survey, the City learned the most highest rated topics that residents look for (or want to look for): 

1. Navigating the city government
2. Attractions and ammenities
3. Make payments 
4. Officials and politics 
5. City environment + infrastructure 
6. Official records and code 
7. Getting around with the transportation network 
8. Daily life 
9. Police and courts 
10. City data sets 
11. Working for the City 
12. Doing business with the City   

From this survey, the City has been able to identify key areas to focus on for redesigning the site's information architecture and creating a better user experience. 



##2. Conduct a Content Audit
Conducting a content audit provides a quantitative understanding of how various webpages on your site are performing. It can help you determine which pages need to be pruned or consolidated on your site, which pages need to be rewritten, which pages are the most heavily trafficked, identify any gaps, and much more. 

In general, your content audit process should: 

* Collect all URLs on your site. 
* Gather KPIs and other information for each page. We suggest using both our [City Analytics Dashboard](https://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/city-analytics-dashboard/), a free tool that runs on Google Analytics, and [URL profiler](http://urlprofiler.com/), a free third-party tool that will gather various metrics, including:
	* Bounce rate
	 * Exit rate
	 * Unique visitors
	* Word count
	* Sentence count
	* Reading level
    * Number of visits 
	
* Analyze your content based on its metrics. Assign a specific action to each URL-- such as "keep", "remove", "update", etc. 

##3. Develop a Content Strategy 
From your content audit, you should have identified your top performing pages. As you build out your content strategy, track progress against these pages. 

Your content strategy should consist of key values that can guide decisions you make about your web's content. This should include: 

* goals for your content
* determine what types of content will live on your website or in [native apps](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/playbook/making-software/mobile-strategy.html)
* identifying a point person (or department) that will see individual pages
* regular intervals for going over your web content's analytics with the appropriate staff
* a plan for regularly updating your content
* methods for conducting ongoing user research to test how users behave with the site's content and features
* strategies to collect on-going feedback from users about your website
* criteria for when content can be archived or deleted 
* on-going plans to train and empower best practices around writing for the web 


##4. Create Internal Content Tools
Equipping your content writers with the appropriate tools is essential to delivering top quality content. In order for your content to be easy to understand and stylistically consistent, we recommend having (and regularly using):

###Style guide
A style guide sets the overall voice and tone for your content. It helps your writers understand how to write in a consistent and effective way. It should establish authority on how certain information is communicated -- be it dates, numbers, acronyms, etc. In addition, your style guide should denote any words that are not to be used, and offer suggestions or replacements. 

Some style guides we particularly like: 

* [Gov.UK's A to Z Style Guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide)
* [Mail Chimp's Style Guide](http://mailchimp.com/about/style-guide/) 
* [Mail Chimp's Voice and Tone Guide](http://voiceandtone.com/)

###Reading level tools
Tools like [Readability-score.com](https://readability-score.com/) can give writers real-time feedback on the clarity and reading level of their content. In general, pages should strive for a 6-8th grade reading level. Using readability tools will highlight which pages on your site need to be rewritten and ultimately help teach your writers how to write appropriate, accessible content. 

#####Spotlight: The U.K.'s Government Digital Service
The U.K.'s Government Digital Service has published some helpful [background research on how users read](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/how-users-read.html
). These findings inform the policies and decisions of their content [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style). 

###Pattern Portfolio
While less specific to your site's written content, you should also have a pattern portfolio to maintain a cohesive and structured visual appearance to your site. 
	
#####**Spotlight: Philadelphia**
As part of its [alpha.phila.gov](http://www.alpha.phila.gov) redesign process, the City of Philadelphia released a [pattern portfolio](http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/patterns/) that defines and shares common design elements on the site. By releasing a template package of the various styles, colors, and HTML markup features on the site, the City can maintain a consistent aesthetic and consistent experience for users. They also [documented their experience](http://phillyinnovates.com/2015/03/11/alpha-phila-gov-update-4-pattern-portfolio/) building the pattern library on their blog.



##5. Hold Content Writing Sessions

The technical aspects of your website are just one component of your site. At its core, a good city website means that information is accurate and easy to understand. This begins with building a strong writing culture and supporting your staff to be confident web writers. 

To do this, we recommend holding content writing workshops to help your team build capability in writing for the web. During these sessions, you can go over your style guide, analytics around your webpage, and hold group exercises to practice writing in a consistent, unified voice.  

Ideally, you should identify one representative from each department to serve as the deparment's designated writer and attend the content workshops. Your writers should have subject matter expertise in the content, some familiarity with (or interest in learning) technology, and an interest in professional development opportunities. 

Having writers from the departments of your website's most heavily trafficked pages is essential. However, for some departments, it may make sense your city's public information officers can maintain their content. This may include departments with low-traffic (or few) pages, or departments ill-equipped to have a designated writer (i.e. the Fire Department). 

###Writing for the Web 
In general, writing for the web means:  

* Using short sentences
* Keeping paragraphs short
* Avoiding jargon and writing in plain English
* Having lots of paragraph breaks
* Using subheadings
