A city website should allow a resident to do everything they can do at city hall from the device of their choice, at any time and any place. 

The internet has changed and improved many aspects of peoples' lives: from education to commerce, from transportation to employment. Cities must now also meet their residents where they are spending more and more time: online.

A city's website is its digital front door. It's a place for it to do business with its residents. Residents should be able to do on a city website anything that they need to do to interact with their local government.
