    <p>In partnership with the City of Somerville, Somerville Public Schools and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Code for America fellows are addressing the question of how to better connect families to services and support they need. A key focus of the team’s work is how to support Somerville’s children to learn and thrive, both academically and socio-emotionally, with the support of their school community and family.</p>

        <p>In a time of national gridlock where municipalities increasingly need to be the driving force for creative problem-solving and innovation, it’s critical to have a nimble organization like Code for America working directly with cities to develop new solutions and accelerate our progress. Our Fellows will be helping to expand data-based decision-making in our schools to improve outcomes for our students, and we are honored that we were selected to host them.&rdquo;</p>

    <h3>Midyear Report</h3>
    <p>Since February the fellows have spoken with administrators and teachers to understand needs within the school. In particular, they are learning from teachers what painpoints and triumphs they experience when using data to inform instruction. The team also spoke to parents to understand the frustrations and joys of raising a child, especially around knowing what resources and support are available. Two main goals of the current work are to increase connections between families and city/school services and to increase access to and use of student data. Read further in their midyear report. </p>
