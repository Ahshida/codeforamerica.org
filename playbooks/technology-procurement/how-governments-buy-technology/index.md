In 2015, it’s normal for government technology projects to be late, over budget or to not work.  These projects have drawn attention to how governments buy and deliver technology to its residents and staff.

Businesses are also dealing with how technology can help them compete, provide better service and do more with less. Like governments, their technology projects are failing as well.

These failures are happening even though procurement is getting stricter and more prescriptive. 

Most government technology is treated like a solution, bought from a vendor in a complex and slow process. Technology is much more complicated than that, but, it’s rare for governments, to understand, develop, deliver and support technology on their own.

The internet, web and smartphones are changing the lives of all Americans are building new, higher expectations of how the world should work. Technology and its ability to deliver significant improvements has massively changed over the last twenty years. 

Large companies like Google, Facebook and Apple deliver services used and loved by hundreds of millions of people for the fraction of the cost of a large government RFP. 

Well-designed government digital services can be so good that people prefer to use them.

Users are surprised when government services work as quickly as commercial services:
