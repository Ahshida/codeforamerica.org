			<h4>What to expect from the webinar</h4>
			<p><b>Before and After</b></p>
			<p>Before each webinar, each course participant will receive an e-mail summary of what each participant can expect from the webinar, and what they should have prepared. After class, notes will be distributed so that you may share the content with your colleagues, and a recording of the webinar will be available in the Code for America library. However, given the brief duration of the course, it is mandatory that at least one staffperson from your agency be present for each webinar.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>During the Webinar</b></p>
			<p>The webinar will be broadcast via a Google Hangout, and facilitated by Garret Jacobs, Peer Network Coordinator at Code for America. Jereme Monteau will be present to introduce himself, and describe the technical support you can expect during the three-week course peperiod.</p>
			<p>Time: TBD </p>
			<p>Link: TBD</p>
			<p>Duration: Approximately 1 hour</p>

            <p>Garrett moved to New Orleans three days before Hurricane Katrina. The move and ensuing activity paved a formative path for his civic engagement. Beginning with the basics of leading design/build community projects Garrett quickly learned the value of community ownership as a pathway to sustainability.</p>

            <p>I have been writing software and building web applications professionally since 1994. My development experience includes building billing systems in Perl, enterprise event servers, graphical user interfaces and web applications in Java, high end consumer websites in ColdFusion and e-commerce websites for non-profits in PHP and Python. Most recently my focus has been consumer web applications in Ruby on Rails with a focus in online video.

            Proud to be a full stack jack of all trades my key strength lies in the ability to quickly understand problems from the end user perspective and delivering their solutions as web applications very rapidly.</p>
