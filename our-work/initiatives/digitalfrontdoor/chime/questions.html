        <h3>Chime Questions</h3>
    </div>

    <h4>Whatâ€™s happening?</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>We&#x2019;re not building ChimeCMS, or any related content management system (CMS) product.</li>
        <li>All of the ChimeCMS work is available on GitHub on an [FOSS/CC whatever licence name] licence </li>
        <li>The Digital Front Door Team team will keep developing and delivering software through service engagements </li>
        <li>We&#x2019;re going to keep providing guidance and help to our partners in government on designing websites that are mobile-ready, services-oriented, and inclusive. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Why was the decision made to stop work on ChimeCMS?</h4>

    <p>We made this decision for two reasons.</p>

    <p><strong>Developing a CMS product requires long-term commitment that CfA is not able to make right now.</strong></p>

    <p>Developing and supporting a complex product requires long-term resources. After our research phase, we felt that it would take longer to deliver a good, meaningful product than could be supported by the organization at this time, when compared to other important work we&#x2019;re doing. </p>

    <p>Delivering ChimeCMS would take resources that we don&#x2019;t have. As a non-profit, we&#x2019;re set up to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Work with governments to better understand the needs of their citizens, and create software to address those needs;</li>
        <li>Advocate for best practices for government services and citizen engagement;</li>
        <li>Create and manage productive environments for community action (brigades); and</li>
        <li>Provide specific issue-focused services to individual cities and counties through the Fellowship program (on-site Fellows).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>There are CMS options available that further many of the website practices we sought to encode into ChimeCMS</strong></p>

    <p>During our research, we discovered new options for government focused content management systems that could be adapted to meet our design principles and practices more quickly than we could develop ChimeCMS. This means we&#x2019;re able to to recommend vendors who can help governments meet their website needs.</p>

    <p>We are not organized to properly support product development. This means we don&#x2019;t have (and don&#x2019;t currently have plans to add) a business support team. Without a team doing product marketing, sales (direct or channel), business development, customer success and support, we wouldn&#x2019;t be successfully set up to bring a CMS (or any other large-scale product) to market.</p>
