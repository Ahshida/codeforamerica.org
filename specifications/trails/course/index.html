            <p>I have been writing software and building web applications professionally since 1994. My development experience includes building billing systems in Perl, enterprise event servers, graphical user interfaces and web applications in Java, high end consumer websites in ColdFusion and e-commerce websites for non-profits in PHP and Python. Most recently my focus has been consumer web applications in Ruby on Rails with a focus in online video.

            Proud to be a full stack jack of all trades my key strength lies in the ability to quickly understand problems from the end user perspective and delivering their solutions as web applications very rapidly.</p>
