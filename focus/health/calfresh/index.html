  <h2>About CalFresh</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>GetCalFresh.org is an easy to use mobile-friendly website that lets people apply for CalFresh in 10 minutes. In California around 40% of people eligible for CalFresh, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aren't receiving benefits. This is the second worst participation rate in the country. While there are many barriers to receiving CalFresh, one of the biggest is that it’s difficult to enroll. GetCalFresh.org provides customer support and makes the enrollment process simpler. GetCalFresh.org currently works with 9 California counties, and has been used by over 1000 people.</p>
