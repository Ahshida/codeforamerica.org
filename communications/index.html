                <p>Founded in 2009, Code for America is a national nonprofit that believes that government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century, if we all lend a hand. Code for America builds open source technology and organizes a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use. By pairing teams of technologists with local governments, Code for America works to redesign core systems and services in <a href="/focus/health/">health and human services</a>, <a href="/focus/safety-justice/">safety and justice</a>, and <a href="/focus/economic-development/">economic development</a>. Code for America has also built a global movement of volunteers dedicated to using their skills to improve local government.

                <h3><strong>Code for America Fellowship</strong></h3>
 
                <p>The Fellowship, Code for America’s flagship program, pairs teams of mid-career, civic-minded technologists with local governments to develop digital tools that help cities and counties deliver core public services. Together, fellows and governments explore answers to local challenges by engaging with the community, building applications to address these challenges, and testing the results. The applications are tangible results of a process that builds much more than a piece of technology—they are vehicles for driving cultural and structural change inside government. After the Fellowship, the governments we partner with increase their digital literacy, tolerance for risk, transparency, and engagement.</p>
                <p>Over the past five years, the Fellowship program has produced more than 65 applications with 38 municipal governments and 126 fellows.

                <h3><strong>Key Messages</strong></h3>

            <ul>
                    <li>The private sector has evolved exponentially over the past decade, adopting new technologies and new ways of working. However, local governments haven’t adapted at the same rate.</li>

                    <li>Code for America pairs teams of technologists with local governments to redesign systems and services—transforming services that don’t work into ones that do, and building digital literacy in the process.</li>

                    <li>Digital government can cost less and work for the public. With inflated populations and dwindling budgets, governments have fewer resources now more than ever. Code for America helps discover ways of doing more with less.</li>
    
                    <li>Code for America fellows and governments work together to engage the community to determine what local challenges to address, build applications to address these challenges, and test the results.</li>

                    <li>It’s not about the apps. The applications created during the Fellowship are the tangible result of Code for America’s partnership with a municipality. However, the partnership does much more than produce a piece of technology—it drives cultural and structural change inside of government, increasing tolerance for risk, and improving transparency and engagement.</li>
