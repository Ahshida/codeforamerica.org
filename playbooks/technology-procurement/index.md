Over the last few years in our work with local and state governments we have seen several high-profile failures in government technology - from new technology being over budget, late, or broken, or existing services with severe problems. These failures have drawn more and more attention to the way that government buys and delivers the technology needed to govern to its residents, staff and citizens. 

This _Government technology procurement_ playbook has been produced in the context of our wider work - the people, practices and products needed to deliver [21st century government](/governments/principles/) - to help governments in America improve the way they buy and use technology to deliver services that work.

This playbook has been split up into four parts: a background guide, general best practices, recommendations for RFPs and structural recommendations for government leadership. 

## [An introduction to government technology procurement](/playbooks/technology-procurement/background/)

## [Writing better technology RFPs](/playbooks/technology-procurement/rfp-recommendations/)

In this guide, we list

* five ways in which technology RFPs can usually be improved; and 
* xx specific recommendations that could be applied to a typical technology RFP

## [Structural recommendations for government technology](/playbooks/technology-procurement/structural-recommendations/)
