    <h2>The 2016 Fellowship in Long Beach</h2>
  </header>
  
  <p>In 2016 Code for America will work with the <a href="http://www.longbeach.gov/">City of Long Beach, CA</a> to develop online tools that help entrepreneurs easily navigate the steps to start, manage, and grow a business. In summer 2015, the U.S. Small Business Administration awarded the City of Long Beach a $50,000 prize through its <a href="https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-initiatives/startup-day">Startup In a Day Initiative</a>, which aims to reduce the amount of time it takes to register and apply for permits and licenses on the local level.</p>

  <p>Currently, a prospective small business owner in Long Beach must navigate multiple agencies, departments, and forms to find information on the registration, licensing, and financing process. This complicated process is also felt on the city side, with staff engaging in multiple information management systems. The Fellowship will create a web application that connects entrepreneurs to business planning resources so they can easily and successfully navigate the registration process.</p>

        <p>We’re excited to collaborate—once again—with Code for America to continue making Long Beach more efficient, transparent, and innovative. This year we're pleased to use technology to increase inclusive engagement of our business community and streamline the way businesses interact with the City digitally. Working with Code for America will have a lasting impact on not only our community, but will further support the way we work to build 21st century government practices within the walls of City Hall.</p>

    <h2>The 2014 Fellowship in Long Beach</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>In 2014, Code for America partnered with Long Beach to reduce 911 calls from addresses that have a high number of calls, while improving health outcomes. Making a difference at even a few of these addresses can have an immense impact. The team's research and data analysis showed a small percentage of the population in Long Beach disproportionately uses emergency services. In 2013, 52 percent of Long Beach emergency medical calls came from only 10 percent of addresses.</p>
    <p>To reduce 911 calls at high-utilizing addresses, the fellows built AddressIQ to facilitate high-touch human interventions. By using meta-data to identify locations withs a high concentration of emergency calls, the fellows' app empowered city staff to share data, collaborate, and direct resources to locations that would be helped most.<p>
