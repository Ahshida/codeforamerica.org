title: What Should A City Website Do?
subtitle: Principles For City Websites
---

The internet has changed and improved many aspects of peoples' lives: from education to commerce, from transportation to employment. Cities must now also meet their citizens where they are spending more and more time: online.

A city's website is its digital front door. It's a place for it to do business with its citizens, a city hall that can be accessed from any location and at any time. Websites are a way to provide the services and information that citizens need simply, clearly and quickly. 

In this guide, we'll cover general principles for city websites, how to start publishing effective web content, and how to prioritize transactional needs.

## General principles for city websites

Based on our [Principles for 21st Century Government](https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/), municipal websites should:

 -  Serve citizens' needs
 -  Make it easy for everyone to be participate
 -  Be produced iteratively
 -  Use data to decide what to do


## Serve citizens' needs

Effective city websites serve their citizens' needs by identifying and thinking about the effective delivery of real user needs. Citizens come to city government websites to accomplish specific tasks and to fulfil needs - even when those needs may at first seem vague. 

When we talk about cities serving citizens' needs, we explicitly mean citizens, not government. Example citizen needs might include choosing a school, starting a new business or paying a bill. 

Every page on a city website should be simple, clear and contain all the information that someone might need. 

## Make it easy for everyone to participate

City websites are another platform that government can use to collaborate with the community and seek participation from all citizens in decisions that affect them. The language that you use on your website should be easy to understand. 

## Be produced iteratively

Citizens expect information on city websites to be up-to-date and correct. The infrastructure behind your website must encourage and make it easy to update the content on your website so that it is correct.

Your city website should also be seen as a continual work-in-progress. Your work can be seen in two phases: foundational work where you are identifying large, current problems and fixing them, and then a new rhythm of operations, where the website is continually iterated and improved upon to better serve existing needs, react to new needs and to monitor and improve performance and security.

## Use data to decide what to do

City websites are already used by citizens, which means decisions can be made using real behavior. Your website should provide you with actionable analytics data that helps city employees decide how design their website and best serve user needs. 

## Publishing effective content

Above all, your content will be effective if it helps your users accomplish their specific need. A large part of publishing effective content is in identifying the right and specific need in the first place. 

Generally, city websites should only publish content that serves a clear citizen need and:
 - is information or a service only provided by the city
 - explains what people, businesses or professionals can do, need to do, or need to do before they can do something
 - is about something regulated by the city
 - explains the purpose of a city organization
 - is, or is about, something the city provides, does or pays for

Use a [survey](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/guides/survey.html) to determine what the most common needs your citizens have when they're visiting your website. You can also learn a lot from [web analytics](http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/city-analytics-dashboard/). 

Make sure your staff have a communication plan so you can start building a practice of producing effective and understandable content. This strategy should include: 
 - a reading age standard (we recommend 9 years old)
 - a requirement to write in plain English that is easy to understand, without jargon or technical terms
 - advice to write in short sentences of up to around 25 words

You should run user research at all stages of content development to make sure that what is being published fulfils your citizens' needs. 

## Prioritizing transactional needs

The simplest way to prioritize which government transactions to improve or deliver via your website is by volume of transactions across channels, but frequently this information doesn't exist. If it doesn't, your first action should be to run a [survey](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/guides/survey.html) and to examine the analytics data for your website.
