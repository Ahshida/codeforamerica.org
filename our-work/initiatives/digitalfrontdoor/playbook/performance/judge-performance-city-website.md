We believe that city websites should: 

###**Be universally accessible**. 
Simply put, city websites should work for everyone.

Questions to start judging your site’s accessibility:
	
* Does your site offer content in all major languages spoken by your residents?
* Is your site responsive to assistive technologies
* Does your site provide a consistent experience to desktop and mobile devices (i.e. they have similar bounce rates)?
* Is your site’s content written at an appropriate reading level?
* Is your web traffic coming from all over town and in different languages?


###**Establish a sense of place**. 
It’s important for your website to be official, provide up to date content, and act as the authoritative place for conducting city business online.

Questions to start judging your site’s officialness:

* How many pages do you have on your website? 
* Are pages being updated to stay current, or retired when they are no longer needed?
* What is the ratio of content on your homepage that is actionable vs. outdated or not a distinct user need?


###**Provide digital services**. 
City websites should *be* the government, not just provide information *about* the government. 

Questions to start judging your site’s digital services:

* Does your site offer digital services?
* How long does it take to complete the service?
* What is the completion rate (start and finish) of the services that your site provides?
* What is the breakdown in transactions happening online than in-person (in city hall or over the phone?)


###**Treat residents with dignity**. 
City websites should be respectful of residents’ time and offer a simple and delightful experience. When sites have good usability, residents are able to quickly find what they’re looking for. 

Questions to start judging your site’s respectfulness:

* Are there feedback loops on your site to better understand users’ experience?
* What is the tone of your site’s content? Is it bossy? Patronizing? 
* Can users find what they are looking for?
* Can residents do what they want to do online?


###**Be resilient**. 
City websites should be able to handle peak traffic on the site.
