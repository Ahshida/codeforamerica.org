  <h2>About the Jail Dashboard</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>Originally built with the city of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/louisville/" target="_blank">Louisville</a> in partnership with the Laura and John Arnold Foundation to address jail overcrowding and provide insight into the jail population profile, the dashboard helps the jail administrator, judges and other stakeholders understand the conditions in the metro jail and use this data to visualize how their decisions - at both the individual and policy level - affect program, facility and inmate outcomes.</p>
