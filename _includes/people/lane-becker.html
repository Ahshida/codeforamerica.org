	    Lane Becker joined Code for America in May 2014 as Director of
Products and Startups. He works to promote widespread reuse of Code
for America applications within cities, and also runs the civic
technology Startup and Accelerator program.

Lane co-founded Adaptive Path, one of the world's first user experience
design firms, in 2001, and Get Satisfaction, an online customer service
community platform, in 2007.

At Adaptive Path, Lane ran the Consulting practice as well as the New
Ventures program, which aided early-stage startups with product
development in exchange for equity. The program saw several successful
exits and also developed Measure Map, a blog analytics tool acquired
by Google in 2005 and incorporated into Google Analytics. Get
Satisfaction is currently used by over 75,000 companies and has taken
over $20 million in investment.

In 2012, Lane co-authored “Get Lucky: How to Put Planned Serendipity
to Work,” a New York Times bestselling business book about harnessing
serendipity as a business practice. He’s also a certified hula hooping
instructor.
