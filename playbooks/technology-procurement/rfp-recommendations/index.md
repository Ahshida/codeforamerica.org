## 1. Require an iterative development process to frequently deliver usable software to users

Services have a much higher chance of success if parts of their functionality can be delivered to users as they are developed rather than as a whole after a long period of development. This is the principle of least surprise: contracts should structure delivery gradually and frequently rather than as a complete solution in a big bang, even if you are using techniques like pilots. 

If you have an RFP that describes a large, complex system, restructure the RFP to require the development of small pieces of functional software as services that will work together over time. If an RFP already exists, it may already describe smaller services that could stand on their own. 

There is less inherent risk to tackle smaller service areas iteratively and individually, rather than requiring the development of a complete system comprising all of them, and to roll out each service to users when it is ready. Where possible, large RFPs should be split up into smaller contracts, each to deliver individual new services. 

These smaller contracts may describe discovery, alpha, beta and live phases of service delivery and follow the suggestions of the [U.S. Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) to [structure budgets and contracts to support delivery](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play5).

You should:

* remove or simplify organizational layers so that features and improvements can be released multiple times a month

## 2. Require a user research capability 

Many big government IT projects end up being digital transformation and organizational change projects that affect lots of people. If a service is meant to bring about digital transformation or organizational change, then the development and delivery of new services must be with and for their users. We have seen governments provide supplemental information like 

Though the State provides additional documentation such as A Day In The Life of Case Workers and Licensing Workers, there is not enough evidence that the State and successful vendors will have user research and user testing to make sure that CWS/NS is simple, clear and easy to use to deliver the anticipated benefits. 

For example, it is unclear how checkpoint builds, quality builds and the user acceptance testing and end-to-end testing phases take into account how the service performs in the hands of its day-to-day users. 

The RFP also shows no emphasis toward user research in general, and hardly any expectation that a successful bidder validate the requirements set by the State. This approach is unlikely to lead to an effective system. 

You should:

* make sure that there is user research capability in the government service team and on the vendorâ€™s team
* make clear that the beginning phase of a project includes a discovery process to understand and validate the needs of users 
* require that the vendor work with the  service team to use qualitative and quantitative user research techniques
* require frequent and regular testing of software with real users during any development phases
* structure other development phases to account for changes that need to be made because of user research and testing
* require that user research is used to make the service simple and intuitive so that users succeed at their tasks first time


## 3. Allow in-house, custom or commissioned options 

RFPs are often written to only consider commercial off-the-shelf software or transfer software (custom software that has already been written for and is being used by another customer), with only a small proportion of custom software. 

Transfer systems may promise a lower initial cost because they have already been delivered for another customer. But, because governments  rarely  own, understand or control transfer systems, it will be more difficult or impossible to get the benefits of a software that is designed to meet its users' needs. Also, transfer systems also mean that governments will continue to lack a good understanding of what's required to 

## 4. Choose vendors who have delivered large-scale services that meet user needs 

Many administrative requirements of RFPs are designed to reduce the risk of getting a solution that doesn't work and to reduce surprise. 

Some ways of reducing this risk are through key staff and certification requirements, but these requirements don't ensure the delivery of good software or services. They just show that certification standards have been met. 

Governments should make sure they have the internal capability to choose a bidder based on their history of delivering large-scale services that meet user needs instead of secondary requirements that will not reduce the risk of bad software being delivered. Successful governments have generally built this capability by putting together multidisciplinary internal teams. 

For example, when creating a federal marketplace for agile delivery services, 18f asked vendors for

> "a live or near-live demonstration of their capabilities (e.g., 24-hour product development challenge) as part of the evaluation methodology. Doing it this way will not only help yield high-quality vendors, but also reduce how much "bid & proposal" expense companies have to incur. Very little, if any, in the way of written responses will be required, as is typically the case."

You should: 

* require vendors to deliver live demonstrations, not presentations or mockups

## 5. Describe ongoing services, not solutions 

Use your RFP to describe a service that continues to improve and not a product or solution that is bought and make this clear to bidders and vendors. Look for opportunities to make it easier for the service to improve after it goes live, whether that's using open standards, or making sure that you're measuring the right data to know what to work on next.

You should:

* use open standards and common or commodity platforms to make it easier to regularly and frequently improve the service 
* simplify the kinds of changes that can be made to the service after it is live
* make user research an essential part of the team that decides changes to the services after it is live
* set key performance indicators for the service
* set and require the collection of performance data to analyze success and choose features and tasks for improvement
