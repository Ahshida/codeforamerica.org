cities X, Y, and Z are doing this, and we should too. 
Roadmap to delivery
Would like writeup in the next two weeks May 14th 

Bringing more people on the City-side into the hangouts. Shows an optimistic view of technology. 







##Content Migration Roadmap

###1. Run resident survey
Start with understanding your users’ online needs. By conducting a resident survey, you can assess the devices and types of internet access used in different parts of your city, evaluate user needs to prioritize content development on your site, and understand where your city has strong and weak connections to users of its website. 

Code for America has worked with the [City of Oakland](http://digifrodo.tumblr.com/post/101788428227/what-are-people-looking-for-on-city-websites) to conduct a resident survey and [developed a guide](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/playbook/user-needs/run-a-resident-survey.html) for other cities to use. In addition, we recommend using tactics in our [civic engagement standard](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/engagement/) to have better reach and a more holistic sample of the community. Analyze the results of your survey to make sure you are achieving geographic representation. Using zip code data, work to achieve a data sample that is reflective of your community. After identifying these gaps, work to disseminate the survey to groups who were not accounted for during the initial outreach.  


###2. Develop a Content Strategy 
At its core, a city website consists entirely of content. Your online content is a representation of your city and the services it delivers. During a website redesign, you are not just migrating over old content- it is an ongoing process where content will be continuously analyzed, updated, refined, and even deleted. You must develop a clearly defined content strategy to reflect this. 



####Content Audit
Conducting a content audit provides a quantitative understanding of how various webpages on your site are performing. It can help you determine which pages need to be pruned or consolidated on your site, which pages need to be rewritten, which pages are the most heavily trafficked, identify any gaps, and much more. 

In general, your content audit process should be: 

1. Collect all URLs on your site. 
2. Gather KPIs and other information for each page. We suggest using URL profiler, a free tool that will gather various metrics, including:
	a. Bounce Rate
	b. Exit rate
	c. Unique visitors
	d. Word count
	e. Sentence count
	f. Grade level
	g. Number of visits
	
3. Analyze your content based on its metrics. Assign a specific action to each URL-- such as "keep", "remove", "update", etc. 

####Internal Content Tools
 Style guide
 Reading level tools

####Content Writing Sessions

A good city website is built upon information that is accurate and easy to understand. This can be achieved by letting subject matter experts (i.e. the department) own their online content, and teaching city staff to be confident web writers. 

Writing for the web background materials. Redesign reader. >> Ask Provo and Jack and Frances “Don’t make me think” book (Steve Krug); Book Apart series 


#####Provo, UT Spotlight
based on learnings from Provo - 1 rep from every department every week. 
total # of people?
Provo: city departments would send someone; Mayor would ask for someone else. Clarify with department heads the qualities that you want. 
Editing the website is done by available admin; urge you to find people who are subject matter experts who understand the content well, person whose job is connected to communicating out information, people who have interest in technology and the web and see this as professional development opportunity
people from department with top traffic websites

Public information officer will maintain content for departments who have small traffic webpages. ie firefighters. 
technical piece is only small part of process; culture change and writing workshops need to be held in order to make it a sustainable content change 
design, IA -- strip those things out. Just start writing together. 




Value of quantitative/ analytical side of URL profile service
	will be an important part of the migration. Getting % of total of visits to get to critical point of total visits. Struggle to marry up Google Analytics with crawler data. Going to build a scraper in the future 

Duplicate content checker tool?
Does it exist on one page or many pages?
URLprofiler.com 

https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aupv-89nVqawdGdPTFZmeEUxSnIwdW9UWmFFWlVlVkE&usp=sharing#gid=0 
Don’t really need keyword matrix for government website
Content Audit page- assign action. improve, delete, etc. 

Run this free thing. 
Similar to set up DFD dashboard
Pull up URL profiler. Link to GA, asks for some kind of validation.
