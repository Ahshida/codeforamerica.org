  <h2>About the Fellowship</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>Code for America pairs teams of technologists with local governments across the country to work in partnership with government officials and the communities they serve.</p>
    <p></p>In 2017, we are looking to partner with several local government agencies within City, County and State governments to develop applications that measurably improve the delivery of a key service that they provide to the public.</p>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
  </header>
  <p>The Fellowship program sends teams of experienced technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials. The fellows apply <a href="/governments/practices">21st Century Government Practices</a> to important problems.</p>
  <p>Over the course of the project period, the fellows immerse themselves in the community, researching user needs, meeting with stakeholders, proposing solutions, and collaborating with the government to build technology using an iterative, user-centered, and data-driven approach.</p>
  <p>While the product of the Fellowship is typically an early stage application that improves the delivery of a government service or function, the process acts as a vehicle for driving cultural and structural change inside of government — encouraging innovation, improving tolerance for risk, and increasing the organizations capacity for transparency and engagement.</p>
