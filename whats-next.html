              What's Next
            </h1>
            <p class="intro">Now that the foundation has been laid for a strong and growing international network , the Code for All community will continue to share our lessons learned, implement programs in partnership with local governments that use technology to improve our communities and document our learnings. We, as Code for All, will act as a platform for anyone, anywhere to start a civic technology project where they live.</p>
            <p class="intro">And all of our efforts will continue to be better because we are connected.</p>

            <h2>Building the Civic Technology Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>Code for All is committed to creating a space for resource sharing and application discoverability to operate at scale and better address shared challenges together. This will take the form of a virtual platform where people can connect to tools and resources from wherever they are, enabling the global civic technology community.</p>
            <h2>Relationship Building</h2>
            <p>Face to face meetings strengthen the community and foster the cross-pollination of ideas across the world. International meetings that bring together our stakeholders will be held periodically to continue to strengthen the network and foster meaningful exchange and shared learnings.</p>
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>We will continue to document our lessons learned and create actionable resources that are useful to our existing partners and others who are just getting started. Code for America has created a “Fellowship Toolkit” that walks the reader through how we implement our fellowship program and provides useful guidance on thinking through CfA Fellowship Program implementation for one’s local context. Code for the Caribbean has created a useful guide to innovation fellowships. As a community, Code for All members will continue to populate our network platform with lessons learned, toolkits and thoughtful documentation and analysis of our programs.</p>

          <h1>The Network</h1>
            <p class="intro">In just one year, the Code for All network has grown from the four founding partners to include thirty programs in eleven countries around the world.</p>

            <p>FLAGS: *Map of all of the international partners similar to the representation on the CfA Brigade website: http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/ but with all of the partner organizations also (you can see all partner orgs here. Map should have the functionality to hover over the tack and have the link to the partner org website appear.*</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>“The Code for All network is a great tool for any group of people interested in developing better governance in their own communities. The tools and experiences that we have had in the last year will serve as examples for new experiences in the coming years. “</p>

              <p>“Code for All is a great peer network. We've learned a lot from the experience and knowledge shared by the Code for All partners. Governments all over the world are facing similar challenges. Being part of Code for All we aim to leverage cooperation between government and the tech community in Germany and thus help governments to become more open and efficient."</p>
