<!-- OUR APPROACH -->
<section class="layout-semibreve">

	<h2>Focus on Safety & Justice</h2>

		<p><img src="/media/images/focus-areas/brent.png" alt="" align="right" width="400" style="margin-left:10px;"/>In communities across the country, there is a broad consensus that our justice system is not working in a safe, fair and effective way. Prison and jail populations have exploded, recidivism rates are stubbornly high and police/community relations are strained. While overall crime rates are low, certain individuals continue to experience high levels of crime and violence, and too often their needs for safer communities and support to recover go unserved.</p>

		<p>To meet these challenges, justice officials need access to accurate, integrated, real-time data to make safe, informed decisions at both the case and system-level. They need digital tools to improve the process of connecting people to much needed health, housing and employment and educational resources, supporting sufficient scale to meet the need. Finally, they need the ability to increase transparency around the inner workings of the justice system, increasing accountability and making possible more productive public dialogue about these pressing issues. </p>

		

		<div class="spotlight">
			<h2>Our Goals</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Make criminal justice data</strong>, and other relevant data, <strong>better integrated, accessible, and accurate</strong> to improve decision making at the individual and system-wide level.</li>
				<li><strong>Connect the right people to the right interventions</strong> to improve public safety outcomes and save money.</li>
				<li><strong>Improve community safety and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and residents</strong>, especially in those communities most impacted by crime and violence.</li>
			</ol>

<!-- HOW WE WORK -->
<section>
	<div class="layout-semibreve">
		<h2>How we work</h2>
		<p>Code for Americaâ€™s focus areas bring together work across all of our programs, delivering an impact greater than what each program might achieve on its own. Across our programs, we undertake deep research into the delivery of critical services, develop new digital approaches to safety and justice, incubate digital products as they mature, and work with the highest levels of government support to scale digital services. Throughout these efforts, we work to empower our partner organizations through the <a href="/governments/principles">Principles of 21st Century Government.</a></p>

		<div class="layout-crotchet">
		    <p><strong>Original Research and Digital Work</strong></p>
        <p>Fellowship teams work with cities and counties to develop innovative digital approaches to delivering key government services.</p>

		<div class="layout-crotchet">
		    <p><strong>Building and scaling Digital Services</strong></p>
         <p>As fellowship teams move on, we work to transform promising new technologies into the mature digital services citizens deserve in the 21st century.</p>

	<h4 class="heading">Partnering with governments to produce original digital services</h4>
	<p><a href="/governments/fellowship/">The Code for America Fellowship Program</a> sends teams of technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials and the community. The fellows apply 21st Century Government Principles to important problems, focused on health, economic development, and safety and justice. While the product of the Fellowship is typically an early stage application that improves the delivery of a government service, the process acts as a vehicle for driving cultural and structural change inside of government.</p>
