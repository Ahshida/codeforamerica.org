This guide is to help leadership responsible for redesigning, re-implementing or overhauling a city website put in place the practices that will lead to delivering radically better digital services.  

## A new way of delivering government services

### Putting users first

Building a good city website means meeting the needs of your users. Your users will have high expectations of digital services, whether delivered by government or private companies. We have a responsibility to meet those expectations. 

This guide is written to help you learn from the teams who are building successful, world-class digital services. You will learn how to place users at the heart of the services you deliver, incorporating their feedback at every step of the way. 

### Iterating with user research

Government services are normally built after long and expensive procurement processes, and users are rarely consulted about the service they'll be using. The first time real users might see a service is when it is made live, by which time it is normally practically too late - and too expensive - to make any changes if the service turns out to be unfit for purpose. 

This way of working and procuring services normally leads to an extremely detailed requirements document or RFP in an attempt to reduce risk. Instead, teams must constantly iterate against user feedback by building, testing and delivering in small, regular pieces, working quickly to deliver improvements.

This approach allows teams the flexibility to work out the best way to meet user needs, to release code regularly and to work in an iterative way. It also makes it much easier for policy and delivery teams to work together.

## Your next steps

### Discovery
We recommend that you start with a discovery phase. This should take no longer than 4 to 8 weeks. 

#### Outputs

Your discovery phase should produce:

 - a prioritised list of user needs
 - a prioritised list of story cards to feed into project teams
 - understanding of team and capability required to complete the project
 - ability to scope and plan an alpha
 - a decision to progress to next phase
 - maybe some rough prototypes
 - maybe some user personas
 - a list of stakeholders and input from them about existing services
 - understanding of existing services, including those run by non-government sources
 - understanding of how many of your users will need assisted digital support, and what their user needs are
