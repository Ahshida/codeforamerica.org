		<h4>What do I need to do as part of the working group?</h4>
		<p>To join the Working Group, you'll need to identify two designated staff members to participate â€” one from a technology or innovation-focused department, and one from the procurement or legal department. Both participants will be expected to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Participate in 2-3 preparatory phone calls with CfA staff and/or advisors before September 2014 to help us understand needs and priorities around procurement in your municipality</li>
				<li>Engage in 1-2 collaborative virtual roundtables with other cities to share ideas, give feedback, and learn from each other's approaches.</li>
				<li>Attend the CfA Summit (September 23-25 in San Francisco) and participate in 2-3 hours of working sessions on procurement</li>
			</ul>
		<p>These are the minimum participation expectations, and we hope to work closely with our working group partners to go above and beyond what's listed here.</p>
