      <h1>
        Hello (title here)
      </h1>
      <p class="intro">As civic technologists we aim to solve problems. Code for All was born from this ethos. We identified a problem in the civic technology community. Having no robust network to share resources and knowledge created redundancies and inefficiencies, making the sustainable growth of the movement difficult and hindering all of our abilities to have the impact we aimed to have where we lived.</p>
      <p>This past year Code for All was created to take the first steps towards solving this challenge by bringing together global leaders in the civic technology community. As the Code for All community we worked together to nurture change agents from around the world who wanted to leverage civic technology to make their cities better places to live, networked them with each other and created resources to support each other in our efforts. Since it’s inception in 2013, we have grown from four founding partners to include members from all over the world. From Pakistan to Ireland, South Korea to Mexico, and many more, we are collaborating, sharing and, most importantly, doing.</p>
      <p>We’re using technology to help farmers protect their livelihoods in Jamaica, make residents in Mexico City safer by equipping them to distinguish between safe and illegal taxis, provide families in Germany with easy to understand visualizations of free childcare centers in their area, and countless others. Most importantly, we’ve shared our experiences, and consulted with and learned from each other along the way. This is only the beginning. As we continue to strengthen the network and build out our civic technology infrastructure our programs will be more efficient, we’ll be able to leverage each other’s tools and resources, we can share best practices and lessons learned, and we can create standards that will make it easier to sustain open government policy and programs. We’ll continue to  increase opportunities to see how others around the world are making a difference in their communities, and learn from their models. It will make all of our programs stronger.</p>
      <p>In just our first year we’ve seen how all of our work can be and is better if we’re connected. And we’re just getting started. Together we are building a global movement with the hope that our efforts will leverage technology to better engage citizens with their governments, improve service delivery and that all of our efforts will be better because we are connected.</p>
      <p>We hope you’ll join us.</p>
