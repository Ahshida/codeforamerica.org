  <h2>About Change My Record</h2>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>Change My Record helps Californians with criminal records get a fresh start. In California, Prop 47 provides individuals with past felony convictions for low-level crimes, the opportunity to request a record change with the court. Change My Record is Code for America’s project to help up to 200,000 eligible Californians take advantage of this opportunity.

These are individuals who have served their time and are seeking to move forward with their lives, but who currently face barriers to accessing student loans, employment opportunities, and stable housing with their families due to their non-violent felony records. The savings from reduced incarceration costs will be invested into drug and mental health treatment, programs for at-risk students in K-12 schools, and victim services.</p>
