                <h2>New Digital Principles for 21st Century Governments</h2>
            </header>
            
           <p>  Through Fellowships with 32 local governments since 2011, we’ve identified seven principles that help governments be more effective, efficient, and fair in the 21st century. Code for America helps local governments learn and apply these principles to <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/">important problems</a>. </p>

<p>We believe these new principles are critical for governments of any size, structure, or political persuasion in serving their communities. </p>

             	<h3>Start with peoples' needs</h3>
        </header>
           	<p>Government’s purpose is to serve residents, and we can do this best when we deeply understand who we’re working for. A 21st Century Government:</p>
           	<ul>
           		<li>Begins any project by conducting research with real people to understand who they are, what they need, and how they behave.</li>
           		<li>Designs processes, policy, and services around those needs, continuously returning to residents to get feedback.</li>
           	</ul>
           
           	
           	<h4>Examples</h4>
           	<ul>
			<li>In Chicago, new civic apps undergo user testing with residents from diverse racial, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds.</li>
		
</div>	
<div class="layout-semibreve" id="everyone">
	<header class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-red">
             	<h3>Invite everyone to take part</h3>
	</header>
		<p>Serving everyone means working with, not just for, a true cross-section of the community. A 21st Century Government:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Proactively creates ways for every community member to take part in decisions and issues that affect them, regardless of language or ability.</li>
		<li>Communicates using language that’s easy to understand, and in ways that are easy to use, with residents both online and offline. </li>
           	</ul>
           	<h4>Examples</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>In Philadelphia, the City Planning Commission let residents give feedback about the Philadelphia2035 District Plan by text message survey.</li>
		</ul>
</div>

<div class="layout-semibreve" id="collaborate">
	<header class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-red">
             	<h3>Work with others</h3>
	</header>
		<p>Government has limited resources to solve complex problems facing our communities, but we can do more when we work together. A 21st Century Government:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Makes relationships with outside partners working towards similar goals — like local universities, community groups, or other governments in their region — to share skills and resources.</li>
			<li>Builds on or borrows existing work when possible, rather than duplicating efforts.</li>
			<li>Makes it easy for others to build on their work.</li>
		</ul>
           	
           	<h4>Examples</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>In Oakland, city officials and a community group collaborated to write answers to the questions that citizens searched for most frequently on the city website.
		</ul>
</div>

	<header class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-red">
             	<h3>Make data easy to find and use</h3>
	</header>
		<p>Open data helps make government better. Governments hold a lot of information that is valuable — and sometimes critically important — to residents, organizations, companies, and government itself. A 21st Century Government:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gets the relevant data to the right people at the right time, in a format that’s easy to understand.</li>
	<li>Makes public data available by default in digital formats so that others can use it in meaningful ways.</li>
</ul>
           	
           	<h4>Examples</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>In Albuquerque, publishing transit data online meant that residents didn’t have to phone the 311 call center to find out bus information, saving the city $180,000 in 2013 alone. 
</li>
			<li>The City of Atlanta reminds residents of their upcoming court dates via text message, helping reduce bench warrants for missed court dates.</li>
	
		</ul>

<div class="layout-semibreve" id="data">
	<header class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-red">
             	<h3>Use data to make and improve decisions</h3>
	</header>
		<p>Good decisions are informed by real-world data, and as we gather more information by testing assumptions, we can make better decisions. A 21st Century Government:
 </p>
 <ul>
 	<li>Uses data tools and analytics to get a more complete understanding of problems.</li>
 	<li>Starts with small solutions, tests them with real people to gather more data, and makes improvements based on those learnings. </li>
 </ul>
           	
           	<h4>Examples</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>In New York City, the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics combined information that had previously been kept by different departments to fight illegal building conversions. By analyzing the combined data, they were able to more accurately identify possible illegal conversions and make better use of inspectors’ time.
</li>
		</ul>

<div class="layout-semibreve" id="procurement">
	<header class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-red">
             	<h3>Choose the right technology for the job</h3>
	</header>
		<p>Today, good governance requires good technology — and for government, accessing or procuring good technology can require new ways of doing business. A 21st Century Government:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Has enough understanding of current, widely-accepted technology best practices to make informed decisions — including when to buy and when to build software.</li>
			<li>Seeks out vendors that work in a lean and agile way to provide user-friendly digital services, and reduces policy and process obstacles to contracting with those companies.</li>
		</ul>
           	
           	<h4>Examples</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>In Philadelphia, the city does direct outreach to local web development firms about opportunities to bid on technology contracts.</li>

		</ul>
</div>

<div class="layout-semibreve" id="organization">
	<header class="badge-heading badge-gov badge-red">
             	<h3>Build multi-disciplinary teams</h3>
	</header>
		<p>These new digital principles require new kinds of teams, and like any organization, government is made up of individuals who need to have the support and resources they need to do their jobs. A 21st Century Government:</p>
           	<ul>
           		<li>Invests in staff to build skills at all levels of the organization, as well as hiring new talent where it’s needed. </li>
           		<li>Recognizes and rewards good work, including trying new approaches and attitudes to risk.</li>
           	</ul>
           	<h4>Examples</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>In Denver, department heads learn how to use Lean methods through the Peak Academy program. After four hours of training, one staff member was able to create $46,000 of annual savings in the Wastewater Division Department.</li>
			<li>In New York City, the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics recruited fixed-term contractors with experience in statistics to improve the government’s data analysis capability.</li>
