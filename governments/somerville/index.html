Right outside of Boston, Somerville is poised for a Code for America fellowship because of its advanced data-driven operations and inclusive community engagement. Code for America will hone in on the educational system to help the Mayor’s team improve educational outcomes for Somerville students. The fellows will develop an integrated data system for the schools that builds upon an existing multi-year partnership between Tufts University and the City. They will further enhance the kind of data-based decision making capability that has transformed municipal government, through statistic programs to the public school environment.

                        &ldquo;In a time of national gridlock where municipalities increasingly need to be the driving force for creative problem-solving and innovation, it’s critical to have a nimble organization like Code for America working directly with cities to develop new solutions and accelerate our progress. Our Fellows will be helping to expand data-based decision-making in our schools to improve outcomes for our students, and we are honored that we were selected to host them.&rdquo;
