                <h2>Our Values</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Code for America believes that a <b>healthy democracy</b> is one in which government continuously strives to better serve the needs of the community, and the community enthusiastically and proactively collaborates with government to improve their city.</p>
<p>Fundamental to this collaboration is a strong bond of trust between government and the community that emerges when <b>transparency, inclusion,</b> and <b>empathy</b> are woven into fabric of every interaction.</p>

<p>This starts in our neighborhoods, our city halls, our community centers. It’s at the local level that government most directly touches our everyday lives — where these values are most tangible.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, we’ve seen how modern technology tools and approaches that reflect these values build trust and help cities better address the challenges they face.</p>

<p>We embrace these values every day as we work towards a government for the people, by the people, in the 21st century.</p>
