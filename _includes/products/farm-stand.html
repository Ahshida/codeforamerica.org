      <p>Once a farm is established, it needs customers. Farm Stand is a collection of tools that urban farmers in West Sacramento can use to easily catalogue what they were growing, when it will be available, where they are selling their produce, and for how much. Residents can sign up to receive either texts or emails, and farmers have a simple mobile interface for updating their available produce before messages are sent to everyone who signed up for them.</p>

      <p><h3 class="text-prominent">Background</h3></p>
      <p>West Sacramento has a vision to become a place where itâ€™s easy to establish urban farms, and where those farms can quickly connect with their surrounding communities to maximize the extent to which farmers and nearby residents alike share in the farm's bounty. The Fellowship program aimed to increase local awareness of, and consumption of food from, local farms. Fellows looked to address food deserts by making it easier to start new urban farms, and enable local farmers to connect with their surrounding communities and promote the sale of farm-fresh produce directly to residents.</p>
