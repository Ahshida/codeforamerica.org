	<h2>Our Approach</h2>

	<div class="layout-minim">
		<br>
		<!-- This section in particular needed breaks following the header to give space between header and content -->
		<!-- inline style reducing top margin to keep text and video top-aligned -->
		<p>Code for America encourages new strategies, including cross-agency collaboration among law enforcement, health and human services departments, schools systems, and others, to implement evidence-based strategies to keep individuals from cycling in and out of the justice system. With particular attention to those communities most impacted by crime and violence, our work is focused on increasing public safety, strengthening public trust, and saving governments money.</p>

		<p>This is an emerging area of Code for America’s work. In the past few years, Code for America has worked with Atlanta and Louisville on key issues in their court and jail systems. In Atlanta, we helped improve court efficiency and, via text messaging updates, helped get busy citizens to their court date and avoid jail. In Louisville, Code for America built a real-time dashboard so prosecutors, administrators, and police officers could see the population numbers in the jail and other vital statistics to better inform release, sentencing, and placement decisions.</p>

		<p>As part of the 2016 Fellowship, Code for America is partnering with Indianapolis and Vallejo on better integrating data into public safety efforts and strengthening law enforcement relations with the community.</p>

<!-- HOW WE WORK -->
<section>
	<div class="layout-semibreve">
		<br>
		<h2>How we work</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Code for America’s focus areas bring together work across all of our programs, delivering an impact greater than what each program might achieve on its own. Across our programs, we undertake deep research into the delivery of critical services, develop new digital approaches to health, incubate digital products as they mature, and work with the highest levels of government support to scale digital services. Throughout these efforts, we work to empower our partner organizations through the <a href="/governments/principles">Principles of 21st Century Government.</a></p>

		<div class="layout-crotchet" style="text-align:center;">
		    <h5 class="heading">Building and scaling Digital Services</h5>
	         <p>As fellowship teams move on, we work to transform promising new technologies into the mature digital services citizens deserve in the 21st century.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="layout-crotchet" style="text-align:center;">
		    <h5 class="heading">Helping Governments Deliver Digital Services</h5>
	        <p>We document what we learn to make building digital government easy to understand and copy through our <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/library/">library</a> and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/peernetwork/">Peer Network</a>.

		<h4 class="heading">Original digital services produced with governments</h4>
		<p><a href="/governments/fellowship/">The Code for America Fellowship Program</a> sends teams of technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials and the community. The fellows apply 21st Century Government Principles to important problems, focused on health, economic development, and safety and justice. While the product of the Fellowship is typically an early stage application that improves the delivery of a government service, the process acts as a vehicle for driving cultural and structural change inside of government.</p>
