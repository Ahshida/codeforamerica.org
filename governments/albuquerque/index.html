We look forward to collaborating with the fellows to identify ways in which we can match citizens in need with critical information and services. This exciting collaboration between the City of Albuquerque, the fellows, and our community will build digital capabilities in the city and continue to strengthen Albuquerque’s position as an innovative place to live, thrive, and do business.&rdquo;

    			<h2>The 2015 Fellowship in Albuquerque</h2>
    			</header>
    		<div align="center">			
    			<p>A key outcome of the fellowship is to connect the dots and standardize some of the communications and data being shared between the city and its residents around economic development departments, initiatives, and community partners. The city would also like to see the fellows ‘refresh’ some of the technology now used for skills based hiring, including hiring within city hall. Another key objective is to improve access to talent for small businesses moving to or operating out of the metro area.</p>
