## 1. Require an agile development process to frequently deliver usable software to users

Services have a much higher chance of success if parts of their functionality can be delivered to users as they are developed rather than as a whole after a long period of development. This is the principle of least surprise: contracts should structure delivery gradually and frequently rather than as a complete solution in a big bang, even if you are using techniques like pilots. 

If you have an RFP that describes a large, complex system, restructure the RFP to require the development of small pieces of functional software as services that will work together over time. If an RFP already exists, it may already describe smaller services that could stand on their own. 

There is less inherent risk to tackle smaller service areas iteratively and individually, rather than requiring the development of a complete system comprising all of them, and to roll out each service to users when it is ready. Where possible, large RFPs should be split up into smaller contracts, each to deliver individual new services. 

These smaller contracts may describe discovery, alpha, beta and live phases of service delivery and follow the suggestions of the [U.S. Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) to [structure budgets and contracts to support delivery](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play5).

## 2. Require a user research capability 

Many big government IT projects end up being digital transformation and organizational change projects that affect lots of people. If a service is meant to bring about digital transformation or organizational change, then the development and delivery of new services must be with and for their users. We have seen governments provide supplemental information like 

Though the State provides additional documentation such as A Day In The Life of Case Workers and Licensing Workers, there is not enough evidence that the State and successful vendors will have user research and user testing to make sure that CWS/NS is simple, clear and easy to use to deliver the anticipated benefits. 

For example, it is unclear how checkpoint builds, quality builds and the user acceptance testing and end-to-end testing phases take into account how the service performs in the hands of its day-to-day users. 

The RFP also shows no emphasis toward user research in general, and hardly any expectation that a successful bidder validate the requirements set by the State. This approach is unlikely to lead to an effective system. 

Governments should:

* make sure that there is user research capability in the government service team and on the vendor’s team;
* make clear that the beginning phase of a project includes a discovery process to understand and validate the needs of users; 
* require that the vendor work with the  service team to use qualitative and quantitative user research techniques;
* require frequent and regular testing of software with real users during any development phases;
* structure other development phases to account for changes that need to be made because of user research and testing

## 3. Allow in-house, custom or commissioned options 

RFPs are often written to only consider commercial off-the-shelf software or transfer software (custom software that has already been written for and is being used by another customer), with only a small proportion of custom software. 

Transfer systems may promise a lower initial cost because they have already been delivered for another customer. But, because governments  rarely  own, understand or control transfer systems, it will be more difficult or impossible to get the benefits of a software that is designed to meet its users' needs. Also, transfer systems also mean that governments will continue to lack a good understanding of what's required to 

## 4. Choose vendors who have delivered large-scale services that meet user needs 

Many administrative requirements of the RFP are designed to reduce the risk of receiving a solution that is not fit-for-purpose. 

Some ways of reducing this risk are through key staff and certification requirements that don't ensure the delivery of good software or services. Certification requirements just show that certifications standards have been met. 

Governments should make sure they have the internal capability to choose a bidder based on their history of delivering large-scale services that meet user needs instead of secondary requirements that will not reduce the risk of bad software being delivered. Successful governments have generally built this capability by putting together multidisciplinary internal teams. 

For example, when creating a federal marketplace for agile delivery services, 18f asked vendors for

> "a live or near-live demonstration of their capabilities (e.g., 24-hour product development challenge) as part of the evaluation methodology. Doing it this way will not only help yield high-quality vendors, but also reduce how much "bid & proposal" expense companies have to incur. Very little, if any, in the way of written responses will be required, as is typically the case."

## 5. Use RFPs to deliver services, not to procure technology solutions

It is clear from the RFP and supporting documentation that responsibility for and management of delivering the CWS-NS solution is spread among many people and groups. In our experience, this had not led to the delivery of effective large-scale digital services. If the intent of CWS-NS is to deliver large-scale positive organizational change in CDSS, then a competent and qualified Digital Director must be appointed with the support of a CWS-NS delivery team. 

The State should:

appoint a CDSS Digital Director with absolute authority over digital services and digital services spending;
create a multi-disciplinary team at CDSS with the authority and responsibility for delivering and iterating upon CWS-NS

This position is inspired by Martha Lane Fox’s letter to Francis Maude, the Minister for the Cabinet Office in the UK that led to the creation of the UK’s Government Digital Service. Lane Fox recommends that this director have the control and power to set standards across CDSS in areas such as:

technical standards: including APIs, data models and security;
content standards: including format, taxonomy, meta-tagging and and rules for syndication partners;
design standards: including usability, accessibility and look-and-feel;
process standards: including content creation, content review processes, SLA and partner processes; and
customer standards: including feedback, consultation, insight, analytics, segmentation and registration.

In particular, this Director should also oversee the re-integration of the spun-out Office of Systems Integration.
