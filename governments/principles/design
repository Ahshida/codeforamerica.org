            <h2>Design for People's Needs</h2>
            
           <p>Government should meet the needs of people who use and rely on their services. In the 21st century, this means designing services to meet user needs and using the best tools digital delivery can offer.</p>

          <p>In producing this standard, we have researched best practices from multiple sources and from our work in fellowships across 32 cities  since 2011.  Some of these findings come from the U.S. Digital Services’ Playbook, which focuses on agile software development and customer-driven processes.  We have also drawn from what the United Kingdom’s  Government Digital Service (GDS) has learned and published in their  Design Principles and Service Design Manual. </p>
          
          <p>Above all, government services must respect citizens’ time, dignity, and abilities, and those of public servants as well. The Code for America Design Standard is a set of practices for teams designing and delivering public services. They ensure that government services are high quality,  easy to use, and responsive to real peoples’ needs-- both the users and the public servants delivering it. Well-designed digital services demonstrate through their design that citizens and government are on the same side.</p>
          
          <p>As governments begin to enact Code for America’s Principles for 21st Century Government, this standard presents a way to evaluate a government’s ability to design and deliver public services that meet people’s needs. This Design Standard is a checklist, not a tactical manual. To learn how to implement these practices, check out Code for America’s Design Toolkit (link forthcoming).

<h2 id="needs">Understand people’s needs</h2> 
<p>The needs of people, not of the policy or the government process, should inform service design decisions. </p>

<h3>Checklist:</h3> 
<ul>
    <li>Identify  existing goals, behaviors, and pain points in the way people accomplish tasks through the existing service. 
Conduct user research with those delivering the service as well as those using it (and who might use it). </li>
    <li>Critically examine any policies that set the constraints of the service (e.g. requiring “wet signatures” on forms over digital one). </li>
</ul>
