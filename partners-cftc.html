      <p class="intro">“It’s about really understanding the users that you’re trying to reach. It might be farmers in a rural area, someone down the road, or it might be the person who fixes your pothole. It’s trying to understand their experience, and then seeing where is it that you can leverage technology in that space to create positive impact.”</p>

      <h2>Helping to Protect Farmer’s Livelihoods in Jamaica</h2>

      <p class="intro">“I always plant one acre for myself and one acre for the thieves.”</p>
      <p class="alignright">John, farmer in Saint Catherine parish, Jamaica</p>
      <p>“The greatest problem that we have as a farmer is farmers stealing from farmers.” Gary, farmer in Saint Thomas parish, Jamaica</p>
      <p>“We spend one billion dollars [a year] importing produce into our country.” Hon. Julian Robinson, Minister of State, Jamaican Ministry of Science, Technology, Energy and Mining</p>

      <p>In Jamaica, praedial larceny (the theft of agricultural produce and livestock) costs the Jamaican agriculture industry more than US$5 million each year. Strategic police checkpoints are supposed to help deter against this rampant theft and protect the farmers in their community.  However, police receive inconsistent access to people in the office who can provide the data they need to make judgment calls in the field. They need to know whether the receipt they are given is valid  or fake - the first validating a legitimate sale and the second cluing the officer into the possible existence of theft. This renders them virtually ineffective in distinguishing between those that steal and those that purchase goods legally, dissuading their efforts to deter against praedial larceny.</p>
      <p>Slashroots implemented the Code for the Caribbean fellowship program to solve problems such as this. They recruited, trained and mentored three fellows who partnered with government officials from Jamaica’s Ministry of Agriculture, the Rural Agriculture Development Authority (RADA) to address this problem. First, they integrated all of the farmer registration and invoice information into one database and created an interface that they could build an application on top of: Harvest API.</p>
      <p>The CftC fellows then developed CLIP, a tool that gives police officers the information they need to differentiate between the legitimate or illegitimate transport of goods in an instant. By using CLIP, a police officer who stops someone at a checkpoint can immediately input the invoice number into their cell phone and receive a text message confirming whether or not the receipt was legitimate. By providing the police with lightweight tools and thereby leveraging technology, they are not only saving the government money but helping to re-establish trust between farmers and the police officers tasked with protecting their livelihoods.</p>
      <p>“The idea is for us to work and to work smarter. . . We had a very good working relationship. It was a learning experience from both ends. . . This is going to lead to developing an Ooen Data policy framework . . . The opportunities from this venture are endless!” - Brad Clarke, Information and Communication Technology Manager, RADA</p>
      <p>“This innovation, this association, a partnership, has saved RADA million of dollars. . . we saved money and we gained knowledge.” - Lenworth Fulton, CEO, RADA</p>
