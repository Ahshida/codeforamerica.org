                        <p>Pittsburgh is a post-rust belt success story, with a booming new economy centered around its universities, hospitals and philanthropic institutions. The city is poised to take the next step with a new administration dedicated to reinventing one of the least sexy but most central functions of government: procurement. Pittsburgh will work with a CfA fellowship team to use technology and user centered design to fundamentally change the outmoded and inefficient way it buys everything from software to paperclips.</p>

                    <p>
                        &ldquo;I am honored and excited that Pittsburgh is joining with Code for America to build the city's reputation for innovation and transparency. We look forward to working in particular on new approaches to procurement that drive increased community participation, and in so doing, build the digital capabilities of our great city. I know the Fellows can learn from us -- and us from them -- as we work together to make government better for city residents.&rdquo;
