    <h3>Over the past five years of building digital services with local governments around the country, we’ve identified seven practices that, when in place, help government work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century.</h3>

    <!------------------Principle 1---------------------->
    <div class="principle clearfix" id="people">

      <!-- Header -->
      <h2>1. Start with people’s needs</h2>
      <p>Begin projects by conducting research with real people to understand who they are, what they need, and how they behave. Design programs and services around those needs, continuously test with users, and refine policy and processes accordingly.</p>

      <h2>2. Ensure everyone can participate</h2>
      <p>Create ways for every community member to productively participate in decisions about issues that affect them.

    <div class="principle clearfix" id="iterate">
      <!-- Header -->
      <h2>3. Start small and continuously improve</h2>
      <p>When you are building or buying government technology, start small and get a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP) into people's hands as early as possible, test with users frequently, and make continuous improvements based on feedback.</p>
