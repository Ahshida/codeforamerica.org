			<h2>Improving Procurement</h2>

			<p>Government purchasing rules have fallen out of step with the pace at which technology now improves, and make it difficult for government to access the most current and relevant tools available.</p>
			<p>Cities and counties around the country are tackling this issue — by piloting new models that give governments more control over the purchasing process, more flexibility in terms of options, and bring new vendors into the ecosystem, while still providing important protections against fraud and abuse.</p>
			<p>We’re looking for more cities to lead the way. Join Code for America's working group to be part of a nationwide cohort of cities and counties who are reimagining procurement for the 21st century.</p>
