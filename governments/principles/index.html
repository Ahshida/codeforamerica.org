           <p>Since 2011, Code for America has partnered with dozens of local governments to apply this approach to deliver better services and outcomes for their communities. We’ve seen that governments of any size, structure, or political persuasion can adopt these practices to better work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century.</p>

                <p>Taking a <b>user-centered approach</b> to designing government services ensures we deeply understand the needs of the people we’re serving -- and that we deliver services that are respectful, inclusive, and easy for everyone to use.</p>

            <h4>What’s possible: Saving time and opening access to Pre-K</h4>
            <div class="layout-minim"> {some picture here} </div>
            <div class="layout-minim"> The Rhode Island Department of Education partnered with Code for America to redesign the pre-Kindergarten application process. By starting with research and interviews to understand the needs of parents and school administrators, they created a new user-friendly registration tool called Golden Ticket that saved over 800 hours of parent and staff time and led to a 20% increase in registrations. Golden Ticket helped Rhode Island win $19 million in federal funding to expand from 17 classrooms to 60 between 2015 and 2019, giving more kids a great start in life. Read more </div>

			 <h4>Checklist</h4>
           		<li>Do research with real people from the community to understand who they are, what they need, and how they behave.</li>
           		<li>Make sure everyone’s voice is represented and meeting people where they already are to invite their input.</li>
           		<li>Design processes, policy, and services to be easy for all residents to use and understand, regardless of language or ability.</li>
